Hello, I'm CJ and I want to show you Handy.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.920
Handy is an open source speech-to-text application that you can run on your own computer.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.440
Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and release,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.220
and Handy will paste whatever you said into the text field you're typing into.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's take a look at the settings menu for Handy, and it's really simple.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.200
You have a push-to-talk mode that you can enable, this is enabled by default so you press and hold the keys or alternatively

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.040
you can turn it off so the transcription starts when you press the key

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.920
combination and it stops when you press it again. And you can also change what

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.320
key binding you would like to use for the transcription. So now it's mapped to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.640
Ctrl-Z and if I turn this off, when I hit control Z,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.400
when you look up in the top corner of my Mac here, this little transcription icon lights up.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.900
And when I click it again, it turns off and transcribes the audio. There's nothing to

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.780
paste into. So it just does nothing here. So sit back, relax, and let Handy give you a hand.

That said, I'd love to push back a little on one specific point, because I think there's a logical tension worth discussing.\r\n\r\nThe app already supports remote LLM calls for text post-processing.

But given that remote LLM is already an option in the app, I'd genuinely love to understand what makes remote transcription categorically different in your view.\r\n\r\nHappy to be wrong here - just trying to understand the reasoning","createdAt":"2026-02-24T11:20:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/886#issuecomment-3951016018","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7rjXA3","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"> The app already supports remote LLM calls for text post-processing.

So the privacy boundary has already been crossed, just at a different layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically it's vibes. And more or less this is a project built on my opinions. And my opinion is that local transcription is good enough, and local LLM is not good enough. \r\n\r\nIt is an alpha feature for a reason. Using an LLM to post process transcription enables a much broader range of possibilities than transcription does fundamentally. Not to mention people who fork the application can take advantage of this without having to do extra work. The class of problems that LLMs and STT models solve is very, very different. Transcription is largely a solved problem locally and LLM is not. I don't like it either, but it is overwhelmingly useful enough that it's important to have I feel. Maybe it's a necessary evil for the time being.\r\n\r\nI think the percentage of people who can reasonably use a local LLM on their machine is significantly smaller than those who can use a local STT model. Until there are good enough small models to handle a wide variety of post-processing use cases, I will not be shipping local models and likely the post-processing feature will stay in alpha until then. I would love for post processing to become the default path.\r\n\r\nAt some point I may want to fine tune a small model, but this means we also have to get a much better understanding of what use cases people are using post processing for. \r\n\r\nI mean I think we can fine-tune a model today probably at a fairly small size and ship it as well. And at some point, likely that will be shipped, but its scope in terms of its prompt acceptance is probably much smaller, and maybe it's just tuned for a few prompts. If anyone wants to help out with this problem, certainly I'd love some help on it. For the most part, it's probably just a synthetic dataset generation task + fine tuning a model around 1B in size or smaller. I would potentially ship that. Especially if the model could be natively trained/finetuned/inferenced in 4bit or 8bit precision. \r\n\r\n> My use case is multilingual transcription ru/en. Parakeet is great for English, but for other languages the quality drops noticeably.

For users in that situation, a fast cloud transcription API would actually be the more pragmatic local-first choice - freeing up local resources for everything else.\r\n\r\nYou can have the program offload the memory for the model when it's not being used, and the cost to spin it up is fairly low because it's done in parallel with when you start recording, so unless you're doing a lot of sentences which are just a few seconds long, you should never feel the latency penalty of loading the model. The model on my computer is never kept in memory. I may eventually make this the default. I just don't really know all of other users experiences, but I have no issues loading the model into memory from disk every single time I do a transcription.\r\n\r\nAnd also to say I do appreciate you trying to contribute and wanting to contribute. And if you want to do the most to contribute today, it would be to help try to solve some of the stability issues so we can start focusing on the bigger picture stuff. If you want to start taking on some of these bigger picture tasks of potentially fine-tuning a model or generating a data set for fine-tuning a model, that's also great. And heck, I mean figuring out community places to have these discussions be more open rather than just in some random GitHub PR. This is all stuff that I don't know anything about and I really need help with. This project is far bigger than me and I'm more or less maintaining it alone. I need help. And that's largely why there is a feature freeze. I fundamentally cannot accept new features right now without solving core issues first. I have a lot of ideas from all of the feedback of where to take Handy next, but I think it's most important to solve the core issues first.

This PR makes that possible by adding support for any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint as a transcription backend.\n\nThe primary use case is **local network servers** (faster-whisper, whisper.cpp, LocalAI) — all fully private, no data leaves your network. As a bonus it also works with cloud providers like Groq or OpenAI Whisper, which some users have requested for accuracy or hardware-constrained setups.\n\nI deliberately kept this scoped and minimal: no new crate dependencies (only enabled existing features `rt-multi-thread` in tokio and `multipart` in reqwest), the entire feature is opt-in (default model is unchanged), and the UI lives in a single collapsible card in the Models settings.\n\n## Why this is different from PR #509\n\nPR #509 exposes Handy **as** an HTTP server (other apps call Handy). This PR makes Handy a **client** — it calls your existing Whisper server. These are complementary, not competing.\n\n## Related Issues/Discussions\n\n- Discussion: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/374 — users asking for whisper.cpp integration; this PR enables it via the server API\n- Discussion: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/241 — REST API discussion with similar intent (API-level integration)\n- Related PR: #509 (different direction — server mode; this PR is client mode)\n\n## Community Feedback\n\nDiscussion #374 has users explicitly asking for whisper.cpp support. This PR enables that use case cleanly without bundling whisper.cpp itself.\n\n## What's included\n\n**Backend (Rust):**\n- `EngineType::Cloud` + `LoadedEngine::Cloud` variant — plugs into the existing engine dispatch with zero changes to the pipeline\n- WAV encoding of recorded audio (16 kHz mono, 16-bit) for API upload\n- `call_cloud_api()` — multipart POST to `/audio/transcriptions`, OpenAI format\n- 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff (300 ms, 800 ms)\n- Credentials re-read on every call (no stale config after settings change)\n- `save_pending_transcription()` + `retranscribe_history_entry` — if all retries fail, audio is saved and user can retry from History\n- Extra params textarea — arbitrary JSON fields passed through (e.g. `temperature`, `prompt`)\n- `block_in_place` to safely bridge sync ↔ async runtimes already used in the transcription thread\n\n**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**\n- `CloudTranscriptionCard` — collapsible accordion in Models settings\n- Live Test button (pings the endpoint with silence, shows ✓/✗)\n- API key is optional (for servers without auth like local whisper.cpp)\n- i18n for all strings\n\n**History:**\n- `cloud_pending` DB column + migration — pending entries show a Retry button\n\n## Testing\n\nTested on macOS 14 (Apple Silicon M3) with:\n- **faster-whisper-server** on localhost — works end-to-end\n- **Groq Whisper API** — works, ~300 ms round-trip\n- **OpenAI Whisper API** — works\n- Failed connection (server down) → audio saved as pending → Retry from History restores transcription correctly\n- Settings change mid-session (URL/key swap) — new credentials picked up immediately on next transcription\n- All 36 existing Rust tests pass, ESLint clean\n\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\n\n> Local server (faster-whisper) configured and active — settings card showing URL, optional API key, model, and test button.\n\n## AI Assistance\n\n- [x] AI was used in this PR\n\n**If AI was used:**\n\n- Tools used: Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6)\n- How extensively: Pair-programming — architecture decisions, code review, and PR preparation were done collaboratively.

Mouse-related imports removed:\r\n  - MSLLHOOKSTRUCT, WH_MOUSE_LL\r\n  - WM_LBUTTONDOWN, WM_LBUTTONUP, WM_RBUTTONDOWN, WM_RBUTTONUP, WM_MBUTTONDOWN, WM_MBUTTONUP, WM_XBUTTONDOWN,\r\n  WM_XBUTTONUP\r\n\r\n2. Mouse hook installation removed (was lines 74-87):\r\n  let mouse_hook = unsafe { SetWindowsHookExW(WH_MOUSE_LL, Some(mouse_hook_proc), None, 0) };\r\n  This installed a system-wide WH_MOUSE_LL hook that intercepted every mouse event on the system.\r\n\r\n3. Mouse hook cleanup removed (was line 116):\r\n  let _ = UnhookWindowsHookEx(mouse_hook);\r\n\r\n4. Entire mouse_hook_proc callback removed (was lines 204-269):\r\n  This was a ~65-line unsafe extern \"system\" function that was called by Windows for every mouse event system-wide. It\r\n  processed:\r\n  - Left/right clicks (only when modifier keys were held)\r\n  - Middle mouse button clicks\r\n  - X1/X2 (side button) clicks\r\n  - All other events (scroll, movement) hit a _ => (None, false) fallback that did nothing useful but still incurred the\r\n   callback overhead\r\n\r\n  The callback always called CallNextHookEx (never blocked mouse events), so removing it has no functional impact — it\r\n  only removes the performance overhead of intercepting every mouse event.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\n<!-- Link to related issues, discussions, or previous PRs -->\r\n<!-- If reopening something previously closed, explain why this should be reconsidered -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/877\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n  - Verified keyboard shortcuts (push-to-talk) still work when Handy is focused and unfocused\r\n  - Verified fast scrolling with MX Master 3s no longer causes cursor lag\r\n  - Verified fast scrolling no longer causes Windows beeping\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n<!-- AI-assisted PRs are welcome!

"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU0NA==","is_bot":false,"login":"parkghost","name":"Brandon Chen"},"body":"## Before Submitting This PR\r\n\r\n**Please confirm you have done the following:**\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pulls) (including closed ones) to ensure this isn't a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n## Human Written Description\r\n\r\nIssue #873 reports that OTA updates create duplicate Windows registry entries. I traced the root cause to `tauri-plugin-updater` v2.9.0 only reading the unsuffixed `windows-x86_64` key in `latest.json` (which points to MSI), so NSIS-installed users receive MSI updates and end up with both HKCU and HKLM entries. v2.10.0 adds bundle-specific target resolution that fixes this. I verified the fix locally with end-to-end OTA testing on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\nAll three issues stem from the same root cause: `tauri-plugin-updater` v2.9.0 cannot distinguish between NSIS and MSI installers, causing NSIS-installed users to receive MSI updates. This creates duplicate registry entries (#873, #159) and requires admin rights that NSIS installs don't normally need (#562).\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\nMultiple users reported duplicate registry entries in #873, #159.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Root cause\r\n\r\n1. `latest.json` has `windows-x86_64` (unsuffixed, points to MSI) plus `windows-x86_64-nsis` / `windows-x86_64-msi` (suffixed)\r\n2. `tauri-plugin-updater` v2.9.0 only reads the unsuffixed key\r\n3. NSIS-installed users receive MSI update → creates HKLM entry alongside original HKCU entry\r\n\r\n### What v2.10.0 does\r\n\r\n[PR tauri-apps/plugins-workspace#2624](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2624) adds bundle-specific target resolution:\r\n- Build time: `tauri-cli` patches `__TAURI_BUNDLE_TYPE` (\"nsis\" or \"msi\") into the binary\r\n- Runtime: updater looks up `windows-x86_64-nsis` or `windows-x86_64-msi` first, falls back to `windows-x86_64`\r\n\r\n### Local end-to-end verification (2026-02-22)\r\n\r\nBuilt v0.7.7 and v0.7.8 locally with `tauri 2.10.2` + `tauri-plugin-updater 2.10.0`, set up a local OTA server serving both NSIS and MSI artifacts with bundle-specific keys, then ran full OTA update flow through the UI:\r\n\r\n| Test | Install v0.7.7 via | OTA updater selects | After update | Result |\r\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|\r\n| NSIS → NSIS | NSIS setup.exe | `windows-x86_64-nsis` → NSIS exe | HKCU v0.7.8 only | PASS |\r\n| MSI → MSI | MSI .msi | `windows-x86_64-msi` → MSI .msi | HKLM v0.7.8 only | PASS |\r\n\r\n### Note for maintainer: `[patch.crates-io]` update needed\r\n\r\nThis PR temporarily points `[patch.crates-io]` to `parkghost/tauri` branch `handy-2.10.2` (the macOS `work_area.position.y` fix cherry-picked onto tauri v2.10.2) so CI can build. Before merging, please:\r\n\r\n1. Create `handy-2.10.2` branch on `cjpais/tauri`: `git checkout -b handy-2.10.2 tauri-v2.10.2 && git cherry-pick 8ba98c7`\r\n2. Update `[patch.crates-io]` in this PR to point back to `cjpais/tauri`\r\n\r\n### For affected users (NSIS install that received MSI update)\r\n\r\nHandy provides both NSIS (.exe) and MSI (.msi) installers. If you were originally installed via NSIS and received an MSI update through OTA, you now have duplicate registry entries (both HKCU and HKLM).\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix is to **uninstall both entries manually and reinstall**:\r\n\r\n1. Open **Settings → Apps → Installed apps**\r\n2. Search for \"Handy\" — you'll see two entries\r\n3. Uninstall **both**\r\n4. Re-download and install from the [latest release](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases/latest) (pick either NSIS or MSI, just use one)\r\n\r\nOnce the updater is upgraded to v2.10.0, future OTA updates will always deliver the matching installer type, so this issue won't recur.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/862eee7d-7de4-4efe-92c6-7389b82c0416\" />\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n- [x] AI was used (please describe below)\r\n\r\n**If AI was used:**\r\n\r\n- Tools used: Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)\r\n- How extensively: Assisted with dependency research, root cause analysis, local OTA test setup, and PR drafting","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7q9oAf","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Looks like we should just be upgrading to tauri 2.10 overall.

I've tested a few but they all didn't have what I wanted. So I came across Handy and saw that the project is public and available to contribute. So I've decided to let Copilot add that feature to Handy. \r\n\r\n- The feature is designed like this that a user doesn't have to constantly press down the transcribe Shortcut and still be able to speak with (more or less) direct responses (instead of having to let go the key to get the transcribed text). So after a ms amount of silence the transcription will happen and the text will appear. Very useful in combination when disabling push to talk.\r\n\r\n- The labels and hints are also translated in to other languages so this can be considered shipment ready.\r\n\r\n- I just haven't tested the signing since I've only built that locally without any signing mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\n<!-- Link to related issues, discussions, or previous PRs -->\r\n<!-- If reopening something previously closed, explain why this should be reconsidered -->\r\n\r\nFixes # ❌\r\nDiscussion: ❌\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\n❌\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have tested this in: \r\n\r\n**Development using**\r\n\r\n    bun run tauri dev\r\n\r\n**Production build using**\r\n\r\n    bun run tauri build\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested your changes and if you need help getting additional testing -->\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"852\" height=\"752\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-20 235835\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9722f27e-fe36-43fb-b5ae-13b4ea795b01\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"852\" height=\"752\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-20 235758\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c34d5284-3ec1-4fe0-9575-c410acce013c\" />\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n<!-- AI-assisted PRs are welcome!

I did a bunch of manual changes to simplify and because AI could not figure out the CSS.\r\n\r\nAI Disclosure Summary:\r\nThe core feature was implemented across three sessions. The initial prompt was to show a live streaming transcript in the recording overlay popup. The AI planned the architecture, then implemented it end-to-end: a `snapshot()` method on the recorder to clone accumulated audio mid-recording, a background thread that periodically transcribes the snapshot and emits events, and a React frontend that listens and displays the live text. Subsequent prompts were iterative refinements — fixing layout issues, debugging a race condition, and simplifying the code.\r\n\r\n| Prompt (paraphrased) | AI Action |\r\n|---------------------|-----------|\r\n| \"Implement a feature where the small popup shown during recording shows a streaming transcript\" | Planned the full architecture, then implemented across 8 files: `snapshot()` on the recorder, streaming loop in `actions.rs`, event emission to overlay, React listener + display |\r\n| \"The text gets cut off when too long. Also do it 1/second\" | Changed interval from 3s to 1s, added CSS word-wrap with auto-scroll |\r\n| (Reported race condition with logs showing concurrent transcription access) | Added a serialization lock to prevent streaming and final transcriptions from colliding |\r\n| \"Transparency gets darker when new text appears\" | Abandoned dynamic window resizing (caused compositing artifacts on GTK). Switched to fixed-size transparent window where content grows via CSS |\r\n| \"Make it so that the transcript and the bars both show — bars below text\" | Modified overlay to show both transcript text AND audio bars simultaneously |\r\n| \"Can we simplify the transcription lock?\" | Removed the separate lock, consolidated engine lock to be held for the full transcription duration |\r\n| \"Why did you change some of the comments?\" | Acknowledged over-editing mistake, restored original comments |\r\n\r\n**Files:** `actions.rs`, `recorder.rs`, `audio.rs`, `transcription.rs`, `overlay.rs`, `RecordingOverlay.tsx`, `RecordingOverlay.css`, `index.html`\r\n","closedAt":"2026-02-20T15:33:33Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qkhGs","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"The UI needs improvements (centering?????????).

I will not accept regressions in terms of UI.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this will perform quite badly on a lot of people's computers (especially those doing CPU inference). Likely because of that it's not going to be pulled in. That is: for systems that cannot transcribe within the given time (500ms) this will lead to inevitable back pressure and unresponsiveness. This is because you're having to retranscribe the buffer every time, And as the buffer gets longer, the amount of time to transcribe it will also get longer. Well it's good for transcription quality, it is bad for long transcriptions and responsiveness of the application.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, all in all, I'm not necessarily opposed to the doing this. It should come after the PR that I'm proposing because this is effectively another streaming methodology. We can kind of wrap all of the streaming methodologies in one place. The main issue I have is the UI change.

Not sure how that can be improved? But yeah I didn't spend much effort on the styling. The reason it switches from centered to left-aligned I guess is because the grid/flex element at the beginning is not full width, that could easily be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> it is bad for long transcriptions and responsiveness of the application.\r\n\r\nWell, pocket-tts advertises 6x real time speed on \"a CPU of MacBook Air M4\". I'm running on a fairly weak laptop and it feels pretty responsive. My use case is mostly short texts though. But for a long text feedback is even more important? This does not block the UI and it should only increase the latency after releasing the push to talk by 1.5x (since the engine is locked it on avg has to wait for 50% of one processing), though this could be reduced to 0 I think, not sure how the engine can handle threading.\r\n\r\n> inevitable back pressure\r\n\r\nBack pressure is good! If processing of 500ms of audio takes 2 seconds then this simply means the UI will only refresh every 2 seconds, taking the latest available audio.\r\n\r\nI did not myself notice any negative change in responsiveness. Yes, for long transcripts This might be a bit of an issue, but what's the worst case? The worst case is pinning the CPU at 100% while you're talking, because at most one transcript is running simultaneously. Ofc. the update interval could also be reduced the longer the text gets if 100% CPU isn't acceptable.","createdAt":"2026-02-20T15:13:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/864#issuecomment-3935524177","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qlLNY","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I don't think you've considered the user experience overall\r\n\r\n> My use case is mostly short texts though.\r\n> The worst case is pinning the CPU at 100%\r\n\r\n> The reason for doing left-aligned text is that when new text is added and you center text, the old text will keep moving around.

And again, I made my very specific point. This may be considered as another option after my PR is pulled in. \r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of time right now and extra features and contributions that don't have specific community support are very unlikely to make it in and be pulled in by me. Right now the app is largely in a feature freeze, I'm going to be the only person pulling in new features for the time being. Anyone can submit new features without a lot of time and effort due to the AI tooling (1 hour is a minuscule amount of time, I've spent probably near 1000 or more hours supporting and building this app). I also use the AI tooling extensively, and I opened source the app so you can fork and add features for yourself! Because I am committed to making this a stable app for everyone.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to help the application, the biggest help would be to be solving the outstanding issues on Linux, because I can't test every configuration very easily, so the more support I have from more users, the better. Right now we're having to focus on stability rather than features because the app is not fundamentally stable across all platforms. And because of this I cannot just keep pulling in new features all the time because it just makes the app more unstable. \r\n\r\nIf you don't like my answer, please fork. Right now I'm committed to the stability of the application rather than supporting every single feature that can possibly be. Someone has to draw the line in the sand for the app and that's me. If you don't like my line, fork.\r\n\r\n\"Your search for the right speech-to-text tool can end here—not because Handy is perfect, but because you can make it perfect for you.\" - I think my line generally supports this quote from the readme as I support forking the application so you can implement the features you want for yourself.

If that model doesn't exist on the new provider's API, the post-processing request silently 404s at runtime. The user receives no feedback — their transcription is pasted without post-processing, and there's no indication anything went wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly likely with the Custom provider, where a user might point the base URL at different APIs over time (e.g., Groq → Cerebras), each with different model naming conventions (`openai/gpt-oss-120b` vs `gpt-oss-120b`).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. **`usePostProcessProviderState.ts`** — `handleProviderSelect` now awaits the provider switch and auto-fetches models for the new provider, so the dropdown is immediately populated with valid options.\r\n2. **`settingsStore.ts` (`setPostProcessProvider`)** — Clears cached model options when switching providers, preventing stale entries from a previous fetch.\r\n3. **`settingsStore.ts` (`updatePostProcessBaseUrl`)** — Clears cached models and resets the stored model to empty when the base URL changes, since the previous model is almost certainly invalid for the new endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nThis doesn't address the broader issue that post-processing failures are completely silent to the user — a toast or overlay notification on API errors would be a valuable follow-up. This PR reduces the likelihood of hitting that silent failure by keeping the model dropdown in sync with the active provider.\r\n\r\n## Origin story\r\n\r\nThis was discovered while setting up a debug workflow for transcript optimization prompts. The goal was to have two prompts in Handy: one using the Cerebras provider (structured output, clean text pasted) and a second using a Custom provider pointed at the same Cerebras API (legacy mode, JSON output with both original and improved text for comparison).\r\n\r\nWith structured-output providers (OpenAI, Cerebras, OpenRouter, etc.), Handy strips `${output}` from the prompt, sends the transcript as the user message, and forces a `{\"transcription\": \"...\"}` response schema — so there's no way to get custom JSON output for debugging. The Custom provider uses the legacy path (single user message, no schema), which allows full control over the output format.\r\n\r\nAfter switching the Custom provider's base URL to Cerebras and selecting a debug prompt, post-processing silently failed. The cause: the model dropdown retained `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (valid for the previous endpoint) instead of `gpt-oss-120b` (what Cerebras expects), resulting in a 404 with no user-facing error.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qG1N5","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thanks this is a good change, I'll review the code when I can and pull it in","createdAt":"2026-02-19T14:31:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/854#issuecomment-3927659385","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qMMQd","author":{"login":"that-lucas"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> Thanks this is a good change, I'll review the code when I can and pull it in\r\n\r\nNo, thanks to you, man!

I realized the correct way to approach this was just by using a \"coordinator\" (aka actor pattern) which gets simple \"notifications\" from the rest of the system, and handles the incoming commands sequentially, naturally brokering access to the transcription state.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This fix doesn't rely on the 30ms debounce, the debounce is just a UX thing as described below.\r\n\r\nOther attempts to fix this only used an AtomicBool, which seems good on the surface, but doesn't truly fix the race condition because it either 1) still causes a lockup in some edge cases (conservative lock) or 2) has multiple pipelines processing at the same time, potentially pasting text interleaved and whatnot. If you only guard the keypress, then you can have multiple push to talk / keypresses accidentally queue up multiple transcriptions.\r\n\r\nBasically, there's a myriad of edge case race conditions that get categorically eliminated by using an actor here :)\r\n\r\n### Part 2 - Debounce for UX\r\n\r\nSecond, this PR adds a 30ms debounce which just helps avoid sound effect spam and needless repeated processing (but again, this is NOT necessary for the correctness guarantee)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\n<!-- Link to related issues, discussions, or previous PRs -->\r\n<!-- If reopening something previously closed, explain why this should be reconsidered -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/64\r\nFixes https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/707\r\nFixes https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/462 (closed, but not truly fixed)\r\n\r\nRelated attempts: \r\n- https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/820 *probably still be useful, dealing with audio race conditions and recovery\r\n- https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/644\r\n\r\nPrevious related PR which attempted to mitigate this but caused the lock up accidentally:\r\n- https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/560\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPRs with community support are much more likely to be merged.\r\n\r\nFor features: Link to a discussion where community members have expressed interest.\r\nFor bug fixes: Link to the issue where others have confirmed the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't gathered feedback yet, consider starting a discussion first:\r\nhttps://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions\r\n\r\nIt is not explicitly required to gather feedback, but it certainly helps your PR get merged.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIssues linked above.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested on linux + wayland using SIGUSR2.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this on macos, or using push to talk keybinds in the app. If someone else is able to test in those environments that'd be great, or we can merge and see how it works out.

On XWayland, the keymap change doesn't propagate fast enough, so the key press fires before the remap takes effect.\r\n\r\nFixed the enigo fallback by explicitly using Shift + lowercase letter for ASCII uppercase, which uses keycodes already in the base keymap and avoids dynamic remapping.\r\n\r\n## Before Submitting This PR\r\n\r\n**Please confirm you have done the following:**\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pulls) (including closed ones) to ensure this isn't a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n## Human Written Description\r\n\r\nShortly after installing Handy I noticed that when using direct paste mode on CachyOS (KDE Plasma Wayland), all uppercase letters were being dropped from transcription output.

Configure a post-processing prompt containing `${OCR}`.\r\n  2. Start transcription with post-processing enabled.\r\n  3. Verified prompt receives OCR text from frontmost window.\r\n  4. Verified fallback to empty OCR context when capture fails.\r\n  5. Verified normal transcription flow is unchanged.\r\n\r\nNote: I have built and manually tested this on a Windows 11 ARM guest running on MacOS. Even with help of Codex, it took hours to build on arm64. I tested that post-processing works both with and without OCR prompts.

App data still went to `%APPDATA%` — not truly portable (as noted by @jsntn and @JoeBarouneD in #753 comments)\r\n2. It added CI complexity for something that didn't fully work\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\n- Issue #153 — community interest in portable mode, maintainer said PRs welcome\r\n- #753 comments — @jsntn and @JoeBarouneD pointed out that a real portable app must store ALL data next to the executable, not in AppData\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses both concerns directly.\r\n\r\n## What Changed\r\n\r\n### Approach: Custom NSIS Template + Runtime Path Redirection\r\n\r\nInstead of a separate ZIP distribution, this adds a **portable mode option directly in the existing NSIS installer** (like Notepad++ does). Users pick \"Normal\" or \"Portable\" during install.\r\n\r\n**Two components:**\r\n\r\n1. **Custom NSIS template** (`src-tauri/nsis/installer.nsi`) — Based on upstream `tauri-v2.9.1` template with 6 targeted modifications:\r\n   - Install type selection page (Normal vs Portable radio buttons)\r\n   - `/PORTABLE` CLI flag for silent installs\r\n   - Conditional default directory (`Desktop\\Handy` for portable)\r\n   - Skips registry, file associations, shortcuts, and uninstaller for portable\r\n   - Creates `portable` marker file + `Data/` directory\r\n   - Auto-detects existing marker file during updates (so the Tauri updater preserves portable mode)\r\n\r\n2. **Runtime path redirection** (`src-tauri/src/portable.rs`) — On startup, detects the `portable` marker file and redirects ALL data paths (settings, models, recordings, logs, WebView2 cache) to `Data/` next to the exe. Nothing touches `%APPDATA%` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.\r\n\r\n### Files Changed\r\n\r\n| File | Change |\r\n|------|--------|\r\n| `src-tauri/nsis/installer.nsi` | New — custom NSIS template with portable mode |\r\n| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | Add `nsis.template` path |\r\n| `src-tauri/src/portable.rs` | New — runtime portable detection + path redirection |\r\n| `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | Call `portable::init()` at startup, use portable-aware paths |\r\n| `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` | Use portable-aware store path |\r\n| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | Add `dirs` crate for fallback data dir resolution |\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n**GUI install:**\r\nRun installer → select \"Portable Installation\" → choose directory → done\r\n\r\n**Silent install:**\r\n```\r\nHandy_setup.exe /S /PORTABLE /D=C:\\MyFolder\\Handy\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Updates:** The updater automatically detects the `portable` marker file — no special flags needed.\r\n\r\n### Maintenance Note\r\n\r\nThe custom NSIS template must be manually synced when upgrading Tauri. Portable changes are isolated and marked with `; --- PORTABLE MODE ---` comments to make merging straightforward. A version comment header notes the base version (`tauri-v2.9.1`).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10 Pro (x64):\r\n\r\n- [x] **Normal install (GUI)**: registry entries, Start Menu shortcut, uninstaller — all work as before\r\n- [x] **Portable install (GUI)**: NO registry, NO shortcuts, NO uninstaller. `portable` marker + `Data/` directory created\r\n- [x] **Silent portable**: `Handy_setup.exe /S /PORTABLE /D=C:\\path` works\r\n- [x] **App data isolation**: in portable mode, all data goes to `Data/` — no `%APPDATA%\\com.pais.handy` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\com.pais.handy` created\r\n- [x] **CI build**: passes on `windows-latest` with NSIS bundling\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the install type selection page -->\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n- [x] AI was used (please describe below)\r\n\r\n**If AI was used:**\r\n\r\n- Tools used: Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)\r\n- How extensively: AI wrote the NSIS template modifications, portable.rs, and PR description.

This PR resolves them:\r\n\r\n1. ~~Add comment explaining platform restriction~~ — no longer applicable, PR #787 added `aarch64-linux` to `supportedSystems`\r\n2. Remove `nodejs` dependency — replaced `patchShebangs` with targeted `substituteInPlace`\r\n3. Use `bun` for shebangs instead of `node` — `tsc`/`vite` shebangs now point to `bun`\r\n4. Use `bun run build` instead of `${pkgs.bun}/bin/bun run build` — `bun` is already on PATH\r\n5. Add comment explaining `doCheck = false` — documents sandbox limitations\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] `nix build .#handy` completes successfully\r\n- [x] `result/bin/handy` binary exists and is executable\r\n- [x] `ldd result/bin/handy` — all shared libraries resolve\r\n- [x] `nix path-info -r .#handy | grep -i node` — returns nothing (nodejs not in closure)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n- [ ] No AI was used in this PR\r\n- [x] AI was used (please describe below)\r\n\r\n**If AI was used:**\r\n\r\n- Tools used: Claude Code\r\n- How extensively: AI applied the changes to flake.nix and ran the nix build verification.

OCR variable exists in the selected prompt\r\n  2. Existing `experimental_enabled` setting is true\r\n- OCR text is truncated to 8000 chars to limit prompt growth.\r\n- On OCR failure, missing permission, or unsupported conditions, OCR resolves to an empty string and processing continues safely.\r\n\r\n## Platform Notes\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n- Added:\r\n  - `src-tauri/swift/macos_ocr.swift`\r\n  - `src-tauri/swift/macos_ocr_bridge.h`\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/macos_ocr.rs`\r\n- Updated:\r\n  - `src-tauri/build.rs` (bridge build/link wiring)\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (module registration, macOS-gated)\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` (template expansion + OCR integration + tests)\r\n- Frameworks linked:\r\n  - Foundation\r\n  - AppKit\r\n  - CoreGraphics\r\n  - Vision\r\n- Permission behavior:\r\n  - Screen recording permission requested on demand\r\n  - Request-at-most-once per app run\r\n  - Graceful fallback to empty OCR context if denied/unavailable\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n- Added Windows OCR provider integration for `${OCR}` / `${ocr}` in post-processing flow.\r\n- Uses `src-tauri/src/windows_ocr.rs` for frontmost-window OCR capture on Windows.\r\n- Wired into shared prompt-template expansion in `src-tauri/src/actions.rs`.\r\n- Behavior is fail-safe: OCR errors resolve to empty context and do not break transcription/post-processing flow.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n- Added:\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/linux_ocr.rs`\r\n- Linux OCR strategy:\r\n  - X11 session: active-window X11 capture path (with root-window fallback), then Tesseract.\r\n  - Wayland session: screenshot-tool fallback, then Tesseract.\r\n- Wayland fallback tools:\r\n  - GNOME preferred: `gnome-screenshot -f <temp.png>`\r\n  - KDE preferred: `spectacle -b -n -o <temp.png>`\r\n  - NOTE: Unlike other implementations, these cli tools take full-screen screenshots.\r\n- Backend selection is detected once at app startup and cached.\r\n- Packaging/build updates:\r\n  - Install `tesseract-ocr` in Ubuntu CI jobs (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)\r\n  - Add Debian runtime dependency `tesseract-ocr` (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`)\r\n  - Add Linux `x11` crate dependency in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`\r\n- Current limitation:\r\n  - Wayland path depends on screenshot tools being installed.\r\n  - This is an interim pragmatic implementation; portal/D-Bus integration can improve this later.\r\n  - GNOME’s `org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot` D-Bus path is noted as a potential follow-up for better window-targeted behavior.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Cross-platform Safety\r\n\r\n- OCR providers are OS-gated.\r\n- Existing transcription and post-processing flows are preserved.\r\n- Unsupported/failing OCR paths degrade gracefully to empty OCR context.\r\n\r\n## Prior Art Check\r\n\r\nI searched upstream issues/PRs for OCR-related work and did not find a matching implementation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added/updated unit tests in `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` for OCR template resolution and truncation behavior.\r\n- Added Linux OCR unit tests in `src-tauri/src/linux_ocr.rs` for backend selection and parsing logic.\r\n- Frontend build and tests pass locally.\r\n- Linux build/test and AppImage build were verified in Ubuntu VM.\r\n- Note: in CommandLineTools-only macOS environments, Apple Intelligence `@Generable` macro tooling may fail independently; this PR does not change Apple Intelligence behavior.\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance Disclosure\r\n\r\n- AI used: Yes\r\n- Tools used: GPT-5 Codex\r\n- Usage: Extensive assistance across implementation, debugging, build validation, and documentation\r\n```","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7nW24-","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Hey, thanks for this. it's gonna take me a while to get to and merge this.

This is especially useful for users on managed machines or those who prefer portable apps. Issue #153 explicitly requested this, and the maintainer said PRs are welcome.\n\nThis PR adds a post-build step in the CI workflow that packages the built Handy.exe and its resources/ directory into a portable ZIP archive for both x64 and ARM64 Windows targets. The ZIP is uploaded alongside the existing NSIS/MSI installers during releases.\n\n## Related Issues/Discussions\n\nFixes #153\nSee also: #567\n\n## Community Feedback\n\nIssue #153 has community interest in portable builds. The maintainer (@cjpais) stated: \"I will accept any PRs or help on this.\"\n\n## Testing\n\n- The change is additive — only new CI steps are added after the existing Tauri build\n- Existing NSIS/MSI artifact generation is completely untouched\n- The portable ZIP step can be validated by triggering pr-test-build.yml on this PR and inspecting the uploaded artifacts\n- The ZIP contains Handy.exe + resources/ directory with all bundled assets (VAD model, icons, sounds, settings)\n\n**To test locally:**\n1. Run bun run tauri build on Windows\n2. The exe and resources appear in src-tauri/target/release/\n3. Copy both into a folder, zip it — that is exactly what the CI step does\n\n**Requirements for end users:**\n- Windows 10 (21H2+) or Windows 11 (WebView2 is preinstalled)\n- Or manually install WebView2 Runtime from Microsoft\n\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\n\nN/A — CI workflow change only.\n\n## AI Assistance\n\n- [ ] No AI was used in this PR\n- [x] AI was used (please describe below)\n\n**If AI was used:**\n\n- Tools used: Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)\n- How extensively: AI wrote the workflow YAML changes and PR description, with human review and direction on approach","closedAt":"2026-02-11T02:35:43Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7mw47r","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thanks.

I verified this on Windows. Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n**Why the original test build didn't have a portable ZIP:** The `pr-test-build.yml` uses `build.yml` as a reusable workflow, and GitHub Actions loads reusable workflows from the default branch (main), not the PR branch.

`command_filter_enabled`\r\n  - `command_filter_scope` (`transcribe` | `post_process` | `both`)\r\n  - `command_filter_order` (`before_llm` | `after_llm`)\r\n  - `command_filter_executable`\r\n  - `command_filter_args`\r\n  - `command_filter_timeout_ms`\r\n- Added helper logic for when secondary shortcut registration is needed.\r\n- Added `src-tauri/src/command_filter.rs`:\r\n  - executes `executable + args` directly (no shell string execution)\r\n  - writes exact transcription bytes to stdin\r\n  - captures stdout/stderr\r\n  - enforces timeout\r\n  - returns applied / failed / empty-cancel states\r\n  - expands `~` / `~/...` in executable and args to home dir before execution\r\n- Integrated filter in `actions.rs` with configurable order relative to LLM.\r\n- Trimmed-empty stdout cancels paste while preserving original transcription in history.\r\n\r\n### Shortcut registration\r\n\r\n`transcribe_with_post_process` now registers if either:\r\n\r\n- AI post-processing is enabled, or\r\n- command filter is enabled and scope includes `post_process`.\r\n\r\n### Commands + bindings\r\n\r\nAdded Tauri commands:\r\n\r\n- `change_command_filter_enabled_setting`\r\n- `change_command_filter_scope_setting`\r\n- `change_command_filter_order_setting`\r\n- `change_command_filter_executable_setting`\r\n- `change_command_filter_args_setting`\r\n- `change_command_filter_timeout_setting`\r\n\r\nWired in `lib.rs` and updated `src/bindings.ts`.\r\n\r\n### Frontend/UI\r\n\r\n- Post Process sidebar section is always visible.\r\n- Removed old Post Processing toggle from Advanced > Experimental.\r\n- Added Post Process > Modes controls:\r\n  - AI Post-Processing toggle\r\n  - Command Filter toggle\r\n- Added Post Process > Command Filter controls:\r\n  - scope\r\n  - order\r\n  - executable\r\n  - args (one per line)\r\n  - timeout (ms)\r\n- Updated settings store mapping for new settings.\r\n\r\n### i18n\r\n\r\n- Added `settings.postProcessing.modes.*`\r\n- Added `settings.postProcessing.commandFilter.*`\r\n- Added keys across all locale files for consistency.\r\n- Updated secondary hotkey description text.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Added: `docs/PRs/general_postprocess.md`\r\n\r\n## Behavior details\r\n\r\n- Filter failures: fallback to previous text.\r\n- Trimmed-empty stdout: cancel paste.\r\n- History on empty-cancel: still stores original transcription.\r\n- Chinese conversion remains before filter stage(s).\r\n- LLM stage still only runs when AI post-processing is enabled and secondary hotkey is used.\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n\r\nAll passed:\r\n\r\n- `cargo check -q`\r\n- `cargo test -q`\r\n- `bun run lint`\r\n- `bun run check:translations`\r\n- `bun run build`\r\n- `bun run format:check`\r\n","closedAt":"2026-02-09T06:37:45Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7mhZvi","author":{"login":"VirenMohindra"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hey @NightMachinery, appreciate the detailed writeup. the summary is thorough and it's clear a lot of work went into this. however, we'd need this to follow the PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` before we can review. the project has a lot of open PRs and inflight work right now so following the template helps us triage consistently\r\n\r\nspecifically what's missing~\r\n- the checklist confirmations (searched existing issues/PRs, read CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- a **human written** description section — a few sentences in your own words about what problem you noticed and why this matters (separate from the technical summary)\r\n- related issues / discussions\r\n- the AI assistance disclosure checkbox\r\n- screenshots (if needed)\r\n\r\nthe technical summary you have is great and can stay, just needs the template sections wrapped around it","createdAt":"2026-02-08T16:36:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/739#issuecomment-3867515874","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7mikFT","author":{"login":"NightMachinery"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@VirenMohindra Hi!

For example, \"ChargeBee\" gets transcribed as \"Charge B\" or \"Charge Bee\", and \"ChatGPT\" becomes \"Chat G P T\". This PR adds n-gram matching that looks at 1-3 consecutive words together, enabling accurate correction of these multi-word speech artifacts while preserving punctuation and case.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\nI've seen [Discussion #168 — Transcript post-processing](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/168), which covers a broad range of post-processing needs (regex replacements, LLM-based cleanup, punctuation handling, etc.). While that discussion explores heavier solutions, I consider this PR to be a fix to the existing custom word correction functionality rather than a new post-processing feature. Just like Levenshtein distance is already used for fuzzy single-word matching, this adds n-gram matching for multi-word cases — a different algorithm for the same purpose, without introducing LLM complexity.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- All existing tests pass\r\n- Manually tested the feature in the app — it works as expected\r\n- Added 5 new test cases covering:\r\n  -

This setup enables global input injection for any process owned by the user, permanently widening the local attack surface and bypassing Wayland’s isolation guarantees.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the portal-based approach keeps input injection scoped, revocable, and mediated by the compositor itself. The trust boundary remains explicit and auditable, aligning with Wayland’s original security goals rather than working against them (see discussion: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/522#issuecomment-3725129696).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Related Issues / Discussions\r\n\r\nFixes #  \r\nDiscussion: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/522#issuecomment-3725129696\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\nNo dedicated feedback thread yet.  \r\nThis change is intentionally scoped to a specific security and architectural axis; broader feedback can be gathered after initial review if needed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ⚠️ Must be fixed (before merge)\r\n\r\n- [x] Some characters with symbols still end up in the wrong position in the string  \r\n- [x] Some characters with symbols don’t appear at all (e.g. “ô”, “û”)  \r\n- [ ] Potential issue with uppercase letters or numbers (not reproducible on my side yet, waiting for confirmation from the reporter (@delthas) to see whether the issue still persists with the new version) \r\n\r\n###  Information about previous fixes\r\n\r\nThe initial problem was that some accented characters were arriving “split”: the letter on one side and the accent on the other (e.g., “é” sent as U+0065 for “e” then U+0301 for the acute accent). Sent separately, the accent was mispositioned or lost. I therefore glued these pieces back together before sending, so each accented character is typed in a single shot.\r\n\r\nThat introduced another issue: if the active keyboard language doesn’t include a character (e.g., a layout without accents), pressing that character is ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I now use the Ctrl+Shift+U method followed by the character’s Unicode code, then validation. This types the symbol directly and works regardless of the chosen keyboard language. I think this is the best solution currently available for managing different keyboard configurations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n**Manual tests only**\r\n\r\n### Authorization, Token & UI Consistency\r\n\r\n- [x] Permission request accepted via the portal and correctly reflected in the UI\r\n- [x] Permission request refused via the portal and correctly reflected in the UI\r\n- [x] Token revocation while the application is running, with immediate UI state update\r\n- [x] Token revocation while the application is closed, followed by application restart and verification that:\r\n  - the stored token is checked against the Flatpak permission store at startup\r\n  - the application state is updated accordingly\r\n  - the UI initializes consistently with the result of this check\r\n- [x] Consistent synchronization between in-memory state, persisted settings, and Flatpak portal permissions\r\n- [x] Verification of correct character injection when the portal authorization is present\r\n\r\n### Useful commands (Flatpak permission store – Remote Desktop)\r\n\r\n **⚠️ Warning:** the commands below operate on the Flatpak permission store for the **Remote Desktop** portal.  \r\nSome of them can remove **all** Remote Desktop authorizations, not just the ones created by Handy.  \r\nAlways inspect the current state before running destructive commands, and only proceed if you are sure no other Remote Desktop permissions are in use.\r\n\r\n- `flatpak permissions remote-desktop`  \r\n  Lists all entries stored in the Flatpak permission table for the Remote Desktop portal.\r\n\r\n- `flatpak permission-remove remote-desktop <OBJECT_ID>`  \r\n  Removes the Remote Desktop portal permission for a **single specific object/application ID**.  \r\n  This is the recommended and safe way to revoke one authorization without affecting others.\r\n\r\n- `flatpak permissions remote-desktop | awk '{print $2, ($3==\"-\"?\"\":$3)}' | xargs -n2 sh -c 'flatpak permission-remove remote-desktop \"$0\"'`  \r\n  Iterates over the Flatpak permission table and removes multiple entries via `flatpak permission-remove`.  \r\n  ❗**Highly destructive** ❗: this can wipe all Remote Desktop permissions at once.\r\n\r\nFlatpak portal permissions rely on a stable application identifier derived from desktop integration (i.e. a `.desktop` entry).  \r\nIn an installed build, this identifier exists and allows Flatpak Permissions to associate Remote Desktop authorizations with the application.  \r\nIn a development context, this desktop integration does not exist, so no stable application ID can be resolved and the permission entry may be empty.  \r\nThis is expected behavior of the Flatpak permission system in dev environments, not a bug in the implementation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Platform Coverage\r\n\r\n- [x] Linux (GNOME Wayland)\r\n- [ ] Linux (non-Wayland / X11)\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots showing:\r\n- Permission request UI and live authorization state\r\n![toto]()\r\n\r\n![handy_wayland_remote_desktop_permission_ui_gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1c66753-95d0-4ece-9116-575007df8a59)\r\nSame source, video format -> [handy_wayland_remote_desktop_permission_ui_video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f69f1f1-5075-4ca3-96d4-ed8f838dc2cd)\r\nprevious version, before the UI update -> [handy_wayland_remote_desktop_permission_ui_video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399375d0-1dbd-4460-b8b9-5391572d20c9)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Active typing session indicator (GNOME screen-sharing icon during injection)\r\n<img width=\"596\" height=\"87\" alt=\"handy_wayland_typing_session_indicator\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd32a616-3825-4204-ab51-08d4e54497df\" />\r\n\r\nNote: The GNOME screen-sharing indicator appears during injection and may linger briefly after completion.

Sent separately, the accent was mispositioned or lost. I therefore glued these pieces back together before sending, so each accented character is typed in a single shot.\r\n\r\nThat introduced another issue: if the active keyboard language doesn’t include a character (e.g., a layout without accents), pressing that character is ignored.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I now use the Ctrl+Shift+U method (example: Ctrl+Shift+U, then 00E9, then Enter → é) followed by the character’s Unicode code, then validation.

This PR demonstrates a pattern that fixes the UI overlay and tray icon: a single source of truth state machine where UI syncs declaratively when the phase changes (similar to React's model).\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the \"Not Responding\" freeze by adding a global lock that prevents concurrent operations.\r\n\r\n**Intentionally pragmatic**: I've kept this PR minimal to avoid overwhelming reviewers with huge changes. It focuses on fixing the immediate issue and demonstrating a pattern that could be extended to other parts of the app in future PRs.\r\n\r\nOther state could be consolidated into this pattern in follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n- Audio feedback timing (stop playing one sound, play the latest sound instead, etc)\r\n- The functionality that mutes the sound on the users system also feels like declarative \"UI\" state, but is out of scope for this PR too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn “Rust way” terms: I made state transitions explicit, serialized with a single lock, and made UI a pure projection of state.\r\n  That’s consistent with correctness-first design.\r\n\r\nI’d pitch it as:\r\n\r\n  - The previous decentralized approach lacked a single source of truth for phase, which caused races.\r\n  - The controller is a minimal, scoped state machine with clear transitions.\r\n  - If we want “Rustier” later, we can evolve it into a channel-driven state machine without changing call sites (hopefully with tests and mock services, or something).","closedAt":"2026-02-16T13:54:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7io1F2","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thanks for this, this is one of the higher priority issues for me.

I chose a draft PR because the code is not production ready, and most likely won't be until we sort out all the details.\r\n\r\nI started from the [openWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord) project, that seems to train wakewords, as well as provide an inference engine based on onnx to run them.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how openWakeWord works, I stripped the entire logic and one example into a single file, very easy to understand, that I provide in this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/tachyonicbytes/850ffd8c7a02d7d87a44521592e46541) here.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are three models, the melspectrogram model, the embedding model from google and the actual wakeword model. And all that's needed is chopping up the audio into suitable pieces (resampling if needed), feeding the input from one model into the other up until the wakeword model, which gives us the prediction. The \"Hey Mycroft\" model seemed to have the best activation from all the models included.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I translated the code to Rust, as a standalone example, provided in this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/tachyonicbytes/1e4be48ef5029ad958642a282d406144) here. There are some more goodies than the simple example here. A project that already ports a form of openWakeWord to rust already [exists](https://github.com/skoky/oww_rs), but I couldn't make it work.\r\n\r\nUsing the functional code from this example, I was able to implement a very rudimentary wakeword function for Handy, using the already present \"Always-On Microphone\", that's a prerequisite for the wakeword to function.\r\n\r\nI posit that the models themselves are small enough and the license is not problematic to distribute them along with the app, not making the user also download them, but closer inspection of the openWakeWord repo should be done in order to do so. Otherwise, we can just download them like we do for the transcription models.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an additional question of stopping the recording after the wakeword was uttered. For the simple example, I did a 5 second delay, but we should find something more permanent here.\r\n\r\nIdeally also, a \"Hey Handy\" model should be trained. The code from the oww repo seems to provide us with all we need in order to do it, we just need the computing capacity and data. I'd be an interesting exercise for the Handy community, if they want their voice / pronunciation to be a part of the model :)\r\n\r\nYou have to manually download these three models from openWakeWord and place them in order to form this directory tree:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord/releases/download/v0.5.1/hey_mycroft_v0.1.onnx\r\nhttps://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord/releases/download/v0.5.1/embedding_model.onnx\r\nhttps://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord/releases/download/v0.5.1/melspectrogram.onnx\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc-tauri/resources/models/embedding_model.onnx\r\nsrc-tauri/resources/models/hey_mycroft_v0.1.onnx\r\nsrc-tauri/resources/models/melspectrogram.onnx\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\n<!-- Link to related issues, discussions, or previous PRs -->\r\n<!-- If reopening something previously closed, explain why this should be reconsidered -->\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\nDiscussion:\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPRs with community support are much more likely to be merged.\r\n\r\nFor features: Link to a discussion where community members have expressed interest.\r\nFor bug fixes: Link to the issue where others have confirmed the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't gathered feedback yet, consider starting a discussion first:\r\nhttps://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions\r\n\r\nIt is not explicitly required to gather feedback, but it certainly helps your PR get merged.\r\n-->\r\nI announced the community on discord, with a video of the feature. @cjpais seemed interested in the code itself, saying that the feature was previously requested, but I couldn't find exactly where.\r\n## Testing\r\nI tested the code manually, because only some e2e tests would be able to test such a vertical feature fully. But there didn't seem to be any e2e tests when I started.\r\n\r\nI also added a test for the activation itself. It requires another external resource, a single-channel 16khz `.wav` file of the wake-word being spoken, that I didn't also include until we sort out what files are acceptable in a PR.\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested your changes and if you need help getting additional testing -->\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\nThe original video\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f8c6e7a-7f8c-4dda-b5e7-dbbe93266127\r\n\r\n<!-- Add screenshots or videos demonstrating the change -->\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance\r\n\r\n<!-- AI-assisted PRs are welcome!

It needed a lot of steering and hand-holding. I originally tried a direct port from openWakeWord, but it failed spectacularly. It couldn't even make the first gist in this PR description, that was made manually. It did translate that code to rust though (the second gist), but bugfixes were needed even then.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7gd-0t","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I just want to say thank you for this and at the very least other people can use this in their forks given you've put it here.

This sends more ambiguous audio to Parakeet, which then struggles and produces stuttering artifacts like `\"wh wh wh wh why\"`.\n\nVoiceInk's 0.7 threshold is more selective - it only passes audio that's clearly speech, giving the model cleaner input.\n\n### Proposed fix\n\nIncrease VAD threshold from `0.3` to `0.5` or `0.6`. Trade-off: might occasionally clip very quiet speech, but should significantly reduce stuttering.\n\nWould be happy to submit a follow-up PR with this change if you'd like to test it.","createdAt":"2026-01-16T13:46:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/589#issuecomment-3760094642","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7gHsxK","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I think if we're gonna tune the vad threshold, we should add it as a slider in the debug menu so we can adjust it directly there and find a good default more broadly.

Or at least, theoretically, since it is a CI change, and I can't reliably test this locally. We might still need a few back and forth testing this flow.\r\n\r\nThe workflow:\r\n1. release.yml triggers build-flatpak.yml after Tauri builds complete\r\n2. Downloads the .deb from the release\r\n3. Builds Flatpak with flatpak-builder\r\n4. Uploads .flatpak bundle to the release\r\n\r\nOne improvement we could do is to upload the .deb as a build artifact to eliminate the downloading from release part, will probably make this more reliable, I just didn't want to touch the existing CI too much since I can't test (but if you prefer, I can explore this path too)\r\n\r\nOther than that, if we want this package on flathub, we also need to:\r\n\r\nOnly for the Initial Submission (One-time)\r\n1. Add screenshots of the app to `src-tauri/flatpak/com.pais.handy.metainfo.xml`, so it can show on the flathub store. Let me know if you have some images in mind, or if I should take some myself 😄\r\n1. Fork flathub/flathub repo on GitHub\r\n1. Create a branch from new-pr (not master)\r\n1. Add the manifest files (just the Flatpak manifest + metainfo)\r\n1. Open a PR against new-pr branch\r\n1. Wait for Flathub reviewers check it\r\n1. After approval, they create a new repo flathub/com.pais.handy and give you write access\r\n\r\nYou can check more details here: https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission\r\n\r\nAfter that its mostly the update process, which can be automated by adding the following to the com.pais.handy.yaml on the flatpak repo they hand to you (not on `cjpais/Handy`'s repo, otherwise we won't be able to build it locally):\r\n\r\n      - type: file\r\n        url: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases/download/v0.6.10/Handy_0.6.10_amd64.deb\r\n        sha256: 7a94f1b17d0b761b570996ed4679a24390dbe7114275c057d392d0742be58769\r\n        dest-filename: handy.deb\r\n        x-checker-data:\r\n          type: json\r\n          url: https://api.github.com/repos/cjpais/Handy/releases/latest\r\n          version-query: .tag_name | sub(\"^v\"; \"\")\r\n          url-query: .assets[] | select(.name | endswith(\"_amd64.deb\")) | .browser_download_url\r\n          is-main-source: true\r\n          release-url-template: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases/tag/v$version\r\n\r\nThe `x-checker-data` is for their update bot to detect when we release a new version on github, it should take the asset ending with `_amd64.deb` and open a PR on the flathub repo to release it (which can also be automated to auto-merge, to be completely hands-off), updating the URL and SHA256 with the new values\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've also just made a few changes to make it pass the flathub linter:\r\n- Made it wayland-first, with x11 as fallback\r\n\t- Because of this, on some environments, depending on the portals available, it may display a gnome-like titlebar even when its not using gnome. This doesn't happen on KDE environments, but e.g. on hyprland it does. The appimage avoids this by running it in xwayland and setting some additional env flags, which is not ideal when we can run it directly as wayland. At first, I did the same on the flatpak version to stay 100% looking the same, but the flathub linter forbids doing that (has to be either x11, or wayland with x11 fallback), so I reverted it. Nothing major changed, aside from the titlebar (top is appimage, bottom is flatpak):\r\n\t- <img width=\"1230\" height=\"1387\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32add82c-bcc2-42ab-a496-069b7dc35ad7\" />\r\n\t- Tested those changes on Hyprland (the error shows fine) and on a Fedora VM I had laying around (the autostart shortcut gets created successfully)  \r\n- Adjusted the autostart handling to do it using desktop portals\r\n\t- flathub also forbids needing the autostart permission, unless when we ask for an exception for this with reasonable arguments. We had this to properly generate the .desktop files no matter the environment we were in, but due to that constraint, I've changed to use the portal instead. Because of this, environments that do not implement the portal will not work with this setting (I've added an UI alert when we can't call the portal). This should work OOTB with major environments like KDE and gnome, but on some wlroots environments the setting will fail, and as a user, you will need to add it to autostart yourself.\r\n\t- This also allowed us to remove the GTK theme filesystem mounts and some portal talk-names from the Flatpak permissions (these were only needed for the X11 theming workaround)\r\n\t- Tested this on both hyprland (flatpak) and the fedora VM (rpm and flatpak), works on both \r\n","createdAt":"2026-01-11T23:33:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/548#issuecomment-3736338579","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7fJOlo","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thank you so much for this, I will review again when I get a chance and try to pull in.

But in the end, this just clips whatever is outside the overlay, so shouldn't break anything\r\n\r\nOn the settings store I moved the autostart logic to src/components/settings/AutostartToggle.tsx, since I wanted to make it a bit nicer when the UI setting fails (with the default logic it just fails silently)\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the git submodule is for us to get the shared flatpak patches to the systray libraries and others, so they behave well on flatpak too\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're curious about anything in specific","createdAt":"2026-02-19T21:26:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/548#issuecomment-3930179275","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-07T10:30:04Z","labels":[],"mergedAt":null,"number":548,"state":"OPEN","title":"feat: add Flatpak packaging support"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOC3j0KA","is_bot":false,"login":"prayzey","name":"Praise"},"body":"## Summary\r\n- Replaces the binary mute toggle with a volume slider (0-100% reduction)\r\n- Cross-platform: CoreAudio (macOS), COM API (Windows), wpctl/pactl/amixer (Linux)\r\n- Persists original volume to disk for crash recovery\r\n- Backward compatible: old mute setting migrates to 100% ducking\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n- [x] Tested on macOS with various ducking levels\r\n- [x] Verified volume restores after recording ends\r\n- [x] Verified volume restores after app crash/force quit\r\n- [x] Tested cancel recording restores volume\r\n\r\n<img width=\"676\" height=\"573\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-01-07 at 11 22 03 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6e9706-f912-4944-b715-56fce932e415\" />\r\n<img width=\"514\" height=\"102\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-01-07 at 11 21 49 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e53ac9-4505-4100-a55a-5fa5c9da8ea7\" />\r\n","closedAt":"2026-02-16T15:01:29Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7dp1BA","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I think we're gonna need some solid validation of this before it gets pulled in.

I wanted the same capability in Handy for hands-free operation without needing to press the shortcut again to stop recording.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues/Discussions\r\n\r\nThis feature addresses the need for hands-free dictation workflows where users want recording to automatically stop after they finish speaking, without requiring manual shortcut activation to end the recording.\r\n\r\n## Community Feedback\r\n\r\nNew feature - no prior discussion. This implements a commonly requested pattern for voice dictation apps.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested on Fedora Linux with the built RPM package\r\n- Cross-platform compatible: uses existing VAD pipeline with no platform-specific code\r\n- Settings persist correctly across app restarts\r\n- Timeout options: Disabled, 2s, 3s, 5s, 10s of silence after speech detected\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos (if applicable)\r\n\r\nSettings UI added under Advanced section:\r\n<img width=\"670\" height=\"553\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f46219b-e778-4096-b576-98a6d185160e\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n1. **Backend (Rust)**:\r\n   - Added `AutoStopSilenceTimeout` enum to settings\r\n   - Extended `AudioRecorder` with silence frame tracking\r\n   - Added callback mechanism to trigger transcription stop\r\n   - Uses existing VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to detect silence\r\n\r\n2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**:\r\n   - New `AutoStopSilenceTimeoutSetting` component with dropdown\r\n   - Added i18n translations for setting labels\r\n   - Integrated with settings store\r\n\r\n### How it works:\r\n- After speech is first detected, the system starts counting consecutive silence frames (30ms each)\r\n- When silence duration exceeds the configured timeout, it triggers the same stop action as pressing the shortcut key\r\n- Only activates AFTER speech is detected, preventing premature stops","closedAt":"2026-02-16T14:38:04Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7b6odz","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Mostly writing here to say I have seen this.

Beyond the core feature, it includes **3 critical bug fixes** discovered during implementation, while iterating, plus tooling improvements for translation consistency\r\n\r\n**Bottom line:** Based on AI assistance and skimming the code on GitHub myself, the architecture is solid, follows existing patterns, and the bug fixes address real user pain points (UI freezes, ghost downloads). code is maintainable and well-structured. There are a few areas worth discussion regarding complexity vs. simplicity trade-offs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 📦 **What's Inside (by commit)** (6 Commits)\r\n\r\n**Feature Evolution:**\r\n1. 45f3315 - core Models Settings page with capability filtering (all / multi-language / translation)\r\n2. b790f55 - language filtering with searchable dropdown (100+ languages)\r\n3. 2edd153 - download cancellation support (`Arc<AtomicBool>` mechanism, **partial file preservation**)\r\n\r\n**Critical Bug Fixes:**\r\n4. fd87206 - translation consistency checker (prevents incomplete i18n at scale)\r\n5. 92a022b - double-click cancel race condition fix (uses `downloadingModels` set as source of truth)\r\n6. 30fdbc9 - download event throttling + intelligent state sync (fixes UI freeze, prevents auto-resume bugs)\r\n\r\n### 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**\r\n\r\n**Code Quality & Maintainability:**\r\n- **Follows existing patterns:** Manager -> Command -> Store -> Component flow (consistent with codebase)\r\n- **Component reuse:** `ModelCard` from onboarding reused in settings (DRY principle)\r\n- **Consolidated event handling:** `useModels` hook eliminates duplicate listeners from 3+ components\r\n- **Clean separation:** UI logic in components, business logic in store, system calls in Rust backend\r\n\r\n**New Components:**\r\n- `ModelsSettings` - main settings page with dual filtering system\r\n- `modelsStore` - zustand store managing download lifecycle (**critical file**)\r\n- `ModelSettingsCard` - contextual settings adapting to model capabilities\r\n\r\n**Backend Changes (Rust):**\r\n- Cancellation via `Arc<AtomicBool>` flags (thread-safe, lock-free, minimal overhead)\r\n- Event throttling (100ms intervals) prevents UI saturation\r\n- Thread-safe state management with Mutex-protected updates\r\n\r\n### 🚀 **Performance Improvements**\r\n\r\n**UI Freeze Fix (Commit 30fdbc9):**\r\n- **Problem:** large model downloads (>1GB) emitted hundreds of progress events per second, freezing the UI completely\r\n- **Solution:** throttle to 100ms intervals (max 10 events / sec)\r\n- **Impact:** 100x reduction in event traffic, smooth UI during downloads\r\n- **Trade-off:** progress updates slightly chunkier (10/sec vs real-time) but imperceptible to users\r\n\r\n**State Management Optimization:**\r\n- intelligent state merging prevents unnecessary re-renders\r\n- `downloadingModels` set provides O(1) lookups vs O(n) array scans\r\n- zustand `subscribeWithSelector` prevents cascading re-renders\r\n\r\n### 🎨 **User-Facing Changes (hopefully for `v0.7.0`)**\r\n\r\n**New Features:**\r\n1. **Dedicated Models Settings** - accessible from sidebar, no longer hidden in dropdown\r\n2. **Advanced Filtering** - filter by capabilities (multi-language support, translation) + language support\r\n3. **Download Management** - cancel in-progress downloads, resume from partial files\r\n4. **Model-Specific Settings** - UI adapts based on model capabilities (addresses your Dec 22 feedback)\r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes Users Will Notice**\r\n- no more UI freezes during model downloads - existing issue iirc\r\n- download cancellation actually works (not just visual feedback)\r\n- progress bars update smoothly without stuttering\r\n\r\n**What Won't Change:**\r\n- model switching still works the same way\r\n- existing downloads are preserved (partial files compatible)\r\n- all existing functionality remains intact\r\n\r\n### 🔍 **Areas for Discussion**\r\n\r\n#### 1. **State Merging Complexity** (`modelsStore.ts` lines 82-105)\r\nthe store uses intelligent merging to prevent race conditions between frontend and backend state. this adds a bit of complexity but solves 2 specific bugs (ghost downloads, UI flicker)\r\n\r\n**question:** is this complexity justified, or should we accept a simpler approach with ~200ms delay for backend confirmation?\r\n\r\n**my take:** the complexity is localized to one function and prevents user-visible bugs. worth it for the UX benefit\r\n\r\n#### 2. **Event Throttling Interval** (100ms)\r\ntesting showed `50ms` = occasional lag, `200ms` = visibly choppy. `100ms` balanced responsiveness and performance\r\n\r\n**question:** should this be configurable, or is 100ms a good default for all scenarios?\r\n\r\n**my take:** `100ms` works well across devices (tested on MacOS and Windows). making it configurable adds complexity for unclear benefit\r\n\r\n#### 3. **Translation Coverage** (12 languages, 36 new keys)\r\nall translations AI assisted per project convention. new CI tooling catches missing keys automatically and blocks PRs\r\n\r\n**question:** are you comfortable with the machine translations for initial release? native speakers can improve later\r\n\r\n**my take:** structural consistency is more important than perfect translations initially. tooling prevents incomplete coverage\r\n\r\n#### 4. **Removed Dead Code**\r\n- Deleted `get_recommended_first_model` command (unused)\r\n- Consolidated duplicate event listeners\r\n\r\n**question:** any concerns about removed code? all deletions were verified unused\r\n\r\n**my take:** cleanup improves maintainability\r\n\r\n### **What I Verified**\r\n\r\n**Code Quality:**\r\n- ci / cd passing, rebased\r\n- no new external dependencies (except std library imports)\r\n- follows project conventions (`i18n` enforcement, component patterns)\r\n\r\n**Functionality:**\r\n- download / cancel / delete flows work correctly\r\n- filtering (capability + language) works as expected\r\n- model-specific settings adapt to capabilities\r\n- no duplicate event listeners (code inspection)\r\n- **partial file resume works after cancel** - pretty cool feature imo, might have some overhead but i believe its worth it\r\n\r\n**Edge Cases:**\r\n- cancel during extraction phase handled gracefully\r\n- rapid cancel-download-cancel clicks debounced properly\r\n- backend / frontend state drift prevented via intelligent merging\r\n- network timeout + cancel don't leave zombie processes\r\n\r\n### 📝 **Recommendation**\r\n\r\n**ready to merge with optional discussion on the complexity trade-offs above.** rhe core implementation is production-quality, the bug fixes are valuable independent of the feature, and the architecture is maintainable\r\n\r\n**Suggested Review Path**\r\n1. **Quick wins**: skim fd87206 (tooling), b790f55 (language filter) - straightforward additions\r\n2. **Core feature**: review 45f3315 + screenshots in PR description - main functionality\r\n3. **Critical sections**: deep dive into~\r\n   - `modelsStore` L82-105 (state merging - **most complex** logic)\r\n   - `model` `Arc<AtomicBool>` cancellation mechanism implementation\r\n4. **Bug fixes**: 92a022b and 30fdbc9 with context from this summary\r\n\r\ni've also posted 6 inline comments on specific code sections highlighting architectural decisions, trade-offs, and areas that might warrant tweaking. these are meant to be educational rather than blocking - they provide context if you want to make adjustments\r\n\r\nlmk if you'd like me to clarify any architectural decisions or provide more detail on specific areas!","createdAt":"2026-01-10T14:50:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/478#issuecomment-3732931277","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7jFIDh","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"You're awesome thank you for this, I'll have some time in a few days to take a more solid look!

The PR still shows only one commit (5899d6c), so it looks like the upstream changes (including 604d78a) didn’t actually land in the branch used for this PR. A typical fix would be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit fetch upstream\r\ngit rebase upstream/main\r\ngit push --force-with-lease\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. GitHub also shows a warning about hidden / bidirectional Unicode characters in the Russian translation file.

Clear and obvious feedback, support, and discussion from the community on the best way forward would probably sway my opinion.\r\n\r\nI may consider this PR if you remove the part with API models for transcription and let's just consider the post-processing part for now. \r\n\r\nAlso if you are implementing API models you should use the support `transcribe-rs` has for it already.. and if it is not sufficient we should add more support there. I know this is almost certainly a vibe coded PR so this probably wasn't thought of. If it was vibe coded it would probably be helpful to know the prompts because at least it shows a clear intent and purpose, because a bunch of LLM generated text as the PR is something I will basically always skip reading because I want to know a humans intention not a machines intention.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have to be a bit defensive of what makes it into the codebase and I really need to have someone who has a strong enough opinion or community support to have things make it into the repo. Not every PR can be accepted otherwise the entire app turns into an unmaintainable mess and it's already close to that in my opinion.","createdAt":"2025-12-17T02:53:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/466#issuecomment-3663403561","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7ahVg1","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"You gotta clean this PR up.

I apologize for not reading through the previous discussions (#77, #279, #222, Discussion #168) before submitting. I've now gone through them and understand your position on keeping Handy primarily a local transcription app. \r\n\r\n## What I've done with this PR: \r\n\r\n- ✅ Removed the API transcription feature as you requested\r\n- ✅ Keep only the LLM post-processing feature which seems to have more community interest\r\n\r\n## Regarding transcribe-rs and future API support:\r\n\r\nI checked transcribe-rs and noticed its `openai` feature currently uses a hardcoded enum that only supports 3 OpenAI models (`whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`). This means providers like Groq and SambaNova won't work out of the box since they use different model names (`whisper-large-v3`, `whisper-large-v3-turbo`).\r\n\r\nI'll raise a PR to transcribe-rs to: \r\n- Allow passing model names as strings instead of the fixed enum\r\n- Add helper configurations for providers like Groq, SambaNova, and others with OpenAI-compatible endpoints\r\n\r\nOnce that's merged, I can create a proper PR for Handy that uses transcribe-rs for API transcription, following your preferred approach.\r\n\r\n## Why this matters to me (and others):\r\n\r\nI have a low-end PC where local transcription is quite slow. Providers like Groq and SambaNova offer extremely fast transcription (often under 1 second) via their OpenAI-compatible APIs, which makes Handy usable for people like me who don't have powerful hardware. I believe there are others in the community with similar needs (like the user in #77).\r\n\r\n## About AI assistance:\r\n\r\nYes, I used AI tools (Claude opus 4.5) to help implement this.  My intent was to: \r\n- Enable fast transcription for users with slow hardware\r\n- Add flexible LLM post-processing with multiple providers\r\n\r\nI should have been more thoughtful about how this fits with the project's architecture and your vision.\r\n\r\nhere is the updated ui for post processing\r\n## post proessing disabled:\r\n<img width=\"1002\" height=\"754\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1e401b0-1162-417c-b2f9-d8b578d0eecb\" />\r\n\r\n## post processing enabled:\r\n<img width=\"1003\" height=\"755\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293254c3-72ad-40f5-bebc-0be6843045a5\" />\r\n\r\n## post processing tab:\r\n<img width=\"1003\" height=\"751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ea98ea-5942-44c0-9ca4-4026d435d602\" />\r\n\r\n## The history remains same as above\r\n","createdAt":"2025-12-17T17:24:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/466#issuecomment-3666400374","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7aob5j","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"> I have a low-end PC where local transcription is quite slow.

My stance has not significantly changed. Please do not submit a PR for it without gathering significant support in Discussions.

I deliberately tried to keep the default experience lightweight: when no rules exist, the form is essentially empty.\r\n\r\nThe intent was to make something approachable. A user can start with just two fields: *“word to replace”* and *“replacement”* and ignore everything else.\r\n\r\n> marginal feature\r\n\r\nTo be honest I don't get this point. I’m not sure how Handy is typically used on your side, but in my own usage it’s hard to imagine using it without some form of replacement layer. Otherwise, users must manually edit nearly every sentence to add punctuation, line breaks, parentheses, etc.\r\n\r\nYes, some LLMs can manage punctuation reasonably well, but:\r\n- they require CPU, disk space, time processing and model management\r\n- results are not always deterministic\r\n- they do not address very simple needs like consistently replacing one word or symbol with another\r\n\r\n> There is already a feature which does this, in addition to post-processing.

My feeling is that rule-based replacements are easier to grasp than LLM-based post‑processing, especially for non‑technical users. \r\nThey are also instant, with low resources requirement and fully deterministic (same input → same output). This makes them complementary rather than competing with LLM post‑processing.\r\n\r\n> The magic commands are quite interesting\r\n\r\nYes and this is where I think a lot of the long‑term value lies.\r\n\r\nMagic commands open the door to many workflows, currently it already offer few possibilities, for example:\r\n- saying *“hello please capitalize”* → `HELLO`\r\n- saying *“open notepad”* → launches Notepad\r\n\r\nMore importantly, they allow users to pipe their text into any external binary for custom processing. Offering this level of openness will almost certainly lead to unexpected and creative use‑cases from advanced users.\r\n\r\n> something this complex\r\n\r\nDo you really feel it is complex from the user’s point of view?\r\n\r\nI understand that the PR itself may look intimidating, but in practice the UI can be used at a very basic level with just two fields. Everything else is optional and intended for advanced usage.\r\n\r\nIf the feature is primarily aimed at advanced users, alternatives could be:\r\n- A dedicated settings tab (like currently) hidden behind an *Advanced / Developer* toggle\r\n- Or behind a \"Replacements\" button in the Post‑Processing tab\r\n\r\nConceptually, this is simply post‑processing without an LLM that's why I have created a dedicated tab.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if some standard users could benefit from a \"standard\" set of pre-set (punctuation) replacements\r\n\r\nI’m confident that this is already true. I will provide an English punctuation preset soon. The current UI already makes it quite easy to create such rules (as shown in the video), and we could initially base them on Microsoft’s punctuation guidelines (even if they’re not always perfect imo).\r\n\r\nThis would also allow you to concretely test the import/export feature 😁.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout current post processing, I may be underestimating the current post‑processing feature, but for users who are not already familiar with LLMs, Handy does not yet really hold their hand:\r\n- discovering which model to use (e.g. qwen3‑a30b)\r\n- installing it\r\n- configuring it correctly for using it with Handy\r\n\r\nIn that context, replacements provide immediate value with almost zero friction, while also enabling things that LLMs simply do not offer.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is one additional idea I deliberately did not include yet:\r\nParakeet V3 currently spell out numbers in words. I almost added a magic command to convert written numbers into digits using the Rust library `text2num-rs`. However, since many PRs tend to be rejected for being out of scope, I chose not to propose it yet.\r\n\r\nThat said, this illustrates the broader idea: Magic Commands are meant to let users send their text through any kind of processing pipeline, very easily without hardcoding every possible use‑case into Handy itself.\r\n","createdAt":"2025-12-15T11:11:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/455#issuecomment-3655063483","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Z-OFB","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Okay thank you for a detailed response and also a genuine and interesting position. I think there are a lot of PR's that honestly are not always as well thought out. A lot are entirely AI slop, with a glimmer of an idea behind them, but not necessarily full rationale. So I often am coming at things from a defensive side as the app's initial purpose is quite slim, and there are a lot of outstanding issues that I typically put as priority in front of features.\r\n\r\n> Do you mean on the user-facing side, or on the code/implementation side?\r\n\r\nmostly on the user facing side. to be precise it's around:\r\n'trim puncutation', 'trim spaces', 'regex', and 'next word'. when I look at it's just visually overwhelming for me. it's functional, but it's a lot of buttons to press. maybe keeping it to just the replacement itself makes sense, with a dropdown for advanced or something. again open to feedback, but generally I prefer less UI and better defaults where possible.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"653\" height=\"454\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-16 at 12 50 20 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a251824-86fd-4ca7-9945-656f74b33fd1\" />\r\n\r\n> To be honest I don't get this point. I’m not sure how Handy is typically used on your side\r\n\r\nFor me Handy is used primarily for programming with LLM's or building up very specific context windows where spelling, punctuation, and precise language is not necessary because a human is not reading it. I do occasionally use it for other things, like typing parts of this message, but my speaking voice is also quite different than my written voice, so there's times at which I choose to use one over the other intentionally. The times that I'm writing with my voice I often have to do a lot of editing because my spoken word is a very conversational style that doesn't always lend itself well to reading. So the minor errors for me are even more minor in comparison to the actual syntactical structure of what I'm saying.\r\n\r\n> When you say this, do you mean there is already a way to define explicit replacements today? If so, could you point me to where this is currently possible?\r\n\r\nI guess this is more the 'dictionary' rather than replacements itself. And upon reading your full message I'm honestly fine to drop/move that feature away from the primary modality potentially.\r\n\r\n> My feeling is that rule-based replacements are easier to grasp than LLM-based post‑processing, especially for non‑technical users.\r\n\r\nyou are correct.\r\n\r\n> More importantly, they allow users to pipe their text into any external binary for custom processing. Offering this level of openness will almost certainly lead to unexpected and creative use‑cases from advanced users.\r\n\r\nthis is the main reason I support this feature and you overall. you are genuinely thinking, and getting me excited to read the code. \r\n\r\n> Do you really feel it is complex from the user’s point of view?\r\n\r\nits the ui point from above. \"in practice the UI can be used at a very basic level\". this is true, but again it's making the \"basic level\" the primary use case. Not adding anything more than is explicitly necessary, and hiding advanced things in creative ways so power users can still do the things they want. I think the app still has much to grow in this way as I'm just figuring everything out. I'm trying to find the best balance for both people using the app without knowing a thing about computers, and also giving power users the tools they want. (theres a reason, and more than one, that A LOT of stuff is in the debug menu). And to be honest with you, I'm the maintainer of a much bigger repo than I ever had imagined in much less time than I expected. Every PR, GitHub Issue, Discussion, is a learning moment for me still, and this one certainly is in that category.\r\n\r\nI could address even more, but I just want you to know I support you and I appreciate the contributions you've made. I think there's some small things we can change and I'll sleep on it with more concrete feedback for the PR. I also need to review the code myself still, and really see how things are working. I love the extensibility you're talking about and intrigued.\r\n\r\nThe standout feedback piece is just minimizing the amount of UI immediately seen. I don't 100% know if this is a sidebar feature or not, and generally might be another thing needs to be tackled in the discussion #449. I think a UI overhaul is long overdue, and really would like to get it into a place where we genuinely feel there is a 1.0.0 release at some point. We are not there yet, but I think as things get more stable, we will start to finalize on all the things that will go into that release.","createdAt":"2025-12-15T18:12:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/455#issuecomment-3656966465","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7aBDN7","author":{"login":"schmurtzm"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> UI complexity\r\n\r\nThat’s true, there are quite a few buttons 😄.\r\n\r\nInitially, the interface only had the two text fields. Very quickly when using it firstly for punctuation, though, a recurring need emerged:\r\n- removing punctuation incorrectly injected by the model\r\n- trimming surrounding spaces, which vary by language (for example, in French there is a space before `:`, unlike in English)\r\n\r\nIt could probably be handled with regular expressions. However, in practice, editing regex patterns is more complex than toggling few simple switches. The typical workflow becomes:\r\n1. define a replacement\r\n2. test it by speaking\r\n3. make a small adjustment (e.g. enable *trim punctuation* or *trim spaces*)\r\nDoing this via simple toggles is fast, intuitive, and pleasant to use, compared to constantly rewriting regexes.\r\n\r\nA good compromise for the UI could be:\r\n- only showing the two main fields by default\r\n- revealing advanced options behind a small dropdown or arrow\r\n\r\n<img width=\"611\" height=\"120\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf16ae89-7593-4424-b6c6-753764023ffb\" />\r\n\r\n<sup>(may be the arrow should be upside the button)</sup>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> How Handy is used\r\n\r\nUnderstood and it’s interesting because my own usage differs somewhat.\r\nI’ve developed the habit of using Handy primarily to respond to instant messaging. As a result, my spoken diction gradually adapts to resemble my written style. Well, I can assure you that it doesn't affect the times when I'm not in front of my computer... At least, I hope not... 😄\r\nThat’s probably a form of laziness when it comes to talking to other humans 😅, but it also means I strongly need my text to be formatted and much more so than inside a prompt.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Dictionary usage\r\n\r\nAh, OK I hadn’t fully understood how this part of Handy worked.\r\nBack in the days of Windows speech recognition (when it was fairly poor), weighted word matching was used: you would provide alternative spellings, each with a weight, to bias the recognizer toward a preferred result.\r\nI assumed something similar was happening here: providing a word so that, when something *close* is spoken, it would be selected over another.\r\n\r\nThis is probably complementary. For example, to manage French punctuation, I’ve sometimes added deliberately odd spellings because the model tends to randomly choose between multiple valid forms (For instance: tiret bas | tiré-bas | tiré bas | tiré-ba\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n> Magic Commands\r\n\r\nDon’t expect too much at this stage 😅 for now, it’s more of a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nYou can already transform text using advanced functions or send the text to an external application but not much more yet. \r\n\r\nThe underlying idea is to give the community the ability to extend Handy’s functionality without having to modify the core codebase. The current [run] mechanism (executing an external command with the text as a parameter) could not be sufficient on its own to fully achieve this goal. It’s a first step, but probably too limited if we want something truly flexible and future-proof ? The real value is that this mechanism is designed to be extended by the community, and in this context, perhaps the first functions made available (uppercase, lowercase, insert date, etc.) should already be outsourced as well...\r\n\r\nSpeaking about the code itself, in full transparency: I would not have attempted this PR without the help of AI.\r\nThat said, I tried to respect the existing structure as much as possible. I won’t take it personally if the structure turns out not to be optimal, or if it doesn’t fully align with the original architecture and needs to be rewritten in some parts.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not the result of weeks of rigorous, manual coding. So it’s an ambivalent feeling:\r\n- pride in being able to bring ideas to life more easily\r\n- and a bit of impostor syndrome (especially when touching other projects that has existed for 10 years 😅)\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I will be happy if it helped seed an idea and produce inspiration for future features / UI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, it’s genuinely a pleasure to read your thoughtful and reasoned feedback, and I fully respect the defensive stance you take toward the project’s original goals when evaluating new features. What’s certain is that Handy doesn’t leave people indifferent, and it’s great to see contributors genuinely engaged.\r\nI’ve also participated in a fairly large GitHub project myself, so I’m very aware of the pressure that comes with community expectations. Keeping some distance, preserving the fun, keeping free time and enjoying the process is essential to avoid burning out 😉\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2025-12-15T21:36:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/455#issuecomment-3657708411","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7aB4I6","author":{"login":"schmurtzm"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@jamaggs, this is a first version of English punctuation rules :  [handy-replacements-english punctuation-v1.0.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24177105/handy-replacements-english.punctuation-v1.0.json)\r\n\r\nYou just have to click on \"import\" button and select the file to start to use it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the action of these replacement rules:\r\n\r\nI made [this english voice sound file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24176704/English.with.punctuation.wav)  (It makes no sense and deliberately overuses punctuation). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I inject this sound file in handy (tested here with Parakeet v3):\r\n\r\n**Without rules:**\r\n\r\n> He was there, ellipsis, line break.

A feature like this is **inherently complicated** and any UI for it will likely be unintuitive to a lot of people. If it wasn't this PR wouldn't have needed the (very good ❤️) video explaining how it works.\r\n\r\n> Alright 🙂. My feeling is that rule-based replacements are easier to grasp than LLM-based post‑processing, especially for non‑technical users.\r\n\r\nI disagree. I can't imagine any non-technical users being able to get this set up without referring to some sort of documentation or tutorial video – which non-technical users aren't gonna do. Since #391 macOS users can do this by choosing \"Apple Intelligence\" and adding a post=processing rule which says _\"Yo, replace stuff like \"full stop\" with an actual fullstop and \"newline\" with an actual newline. And make sure everything is well formatted. Like apple dictation, ya know?\"_ and it'd probably work fine.\r\n\r\nThe UI here reminded me of the settings for [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) - extremely powerful and flexible if you are used to looking at \"power user\" UIs like this and are starting from a mental model which includes \"I know what a string is and what string replacement means\". I'm certain that the majority of users who are active in this repo/discord could work out how to use this UI...\r\n\r\n<img width=\"336\" height=\"110\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-18 at 23 05 58\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c21368ad-3bfb-40f9-94bd-db3f2ce839a0\" />\r\n\r\nBut I'd guess there are a huge number of users who wouldn't (we already know a lot of new users struggle to understand the General settings pane on first use).\r\n\r\nThe [newer UI](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/455#issuecomment-3659698207) is waaaaay better, but still.\r\n\r\nFor me, one of the strengths of Handy is that it's pretty easy for normal people to understand. And hopefully after #449 it'll be even moreso. I used to use Voiceink and tbh one of the reasons I stopped is because the settings UI got so full of features that I had no fucking idea how anything worked, and no inclination to spend 40 minutes of my life learning how to configure my **press-a-button-and-talk-to-my-computer-to-save-me-time app**. And I'm definitely a technical user.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that **I feel like this is a really valuable feature**, which I'd 💯 use myself. \r\n\r\nThoughts in no particular order:\r\n\r\n- I want this.\r\n- This should be \"Advanced\" in the settings and clearly explain that it's kinda for \"power users\".\r\n- We can probably improve the UX a bit by rethinking the UI – I almost wanna give this to a UX expert as a challenge.\r\n- Said friend will probably say \"mate, it's an inherently complicated feature that includes the word regex this is hard\"\r\n- I wonder if we could hide the actual rule builder away in some advanced place and surface a bunch of \"presets\" for common settings somewhere more visible. eg a \"replace punctuation words with actual punctuation\" toggle just adds/removes some preset rules. Etc.\r\n- The magic commands are cool, but feel like a separate feature.\r\n- As ever: _features which add significant UI can be a slippery slope to Photoshop, so let's get them right._ (I do not think this one is UI bloat)\r\n\r\n@schmurtzm @VirenMohindra @cjpais Just wanna repeat how nice it is to see people who care about quality doing good work.

I'm not sure this feature belongs in Handy.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate on that second point beyond \"I wouldn't use it myself\"... \r\n\r\nHandy is a utility app which to me means:\r\n\r\n- It should do what users expect **really well**, reliably, and on all platforms.\r\n- It should do nothing else.\r\n\r\nHandy's primary UI is a keyboard shortcut and the `RecordingOverlay`. The settings window should be just that - a place to configure Handy which users never look at unless they're changing a setting. We should be focused on adding features which make voice transcription work **really well** in as many contexts as possible. Features like this feel like a (small) step in a different direction, and my main concern is that it's a slippery slope to code and feature bloat down the line. To quote @cjpais on the website (bold mine):\r\n\r\n> Handy isn’t trying to be the best speech-to-text app. It’s trying to be the most forkable one.\r\n> \r\n> Handy is a starting point for when you need accessibility features, want to experiment with voice computing, or just prefer tools you can actually own and modify. **The project is designed to be tiny and extensible**. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, if it turns out a load of people really want this, I've no strong objection.\r\n\r\n@VirenMohindra As someone who obviously would find this valuable, I'm legit interested in your use case.

Standard shortcut libraries (like `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`) cannot capture modifier-only keys.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n**Parallel input system for fn key:**\r\n\r\n1. **`src-tauri/src/shortcut/fn_monitor.rs`** (macOS-only)\r\n   - Uses `NSEvent::addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask_handler` from objc2\r\n   - Monitors for `NSEventMask::FlagsChanged` events\r\n   - Checks `NSEventModifierFlags::Function` to detect fn press/release\r\n   - Calls the same `dispatch_binding_event()` function as regular shortcuts\r\n\r\n2. **`src-tauri/src/shortcut/mod.rs`**\r\n   - Routes \"fn\" bindings to `fn_monitor` instead of `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`\r\n   - `is_fn_binding()` helper checks for fn-only bindings\r\n   - `validate_shortcut_string()` allows \"fn\" as valid on macOS\r\n\r\n3. **Dependencies (macOS only in Cargo.toml)**:\r\n   ```toml\r\n   [target.'cfg(target_os = \"macos\")'.dependencies]\r\n   objc2 = \"0.6\"\r\n   objc2-app-kit = { version = \"0.3\", features = [\"NSEvent\"] }\r\n   objc2-foundation = \"0.3\"\r\n   block2 = \"0.6\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Frontend** (optional): \"Use fn\" button in `HandyShortcut.tsx` - see [Reviewer Notes](#reviewer-notes-fn-key-ui)\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n\r\nRequires **Accessibility permission** (same as already needed for `enigo` pasting). No additional permission prompts for users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Feature 2: Escape to Cancel Recording\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nThe cancel shortcut is a **dynamic binding** - only registered while recording is active.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n1. **`CancelAction`** in `actions.rs`:\r\n   - Calls `cancel_current_operation()` to discard recording\r\n   - Does NOT unregister itself (would deadlock inside callback)\r\n\r\n2. **Cancel binding** in `settings.rs`:\r\n   - `dynamic: true` - not registered at startup\r\n   - Default binding: \"Escape\"\r\n\r\n3. **Dynamic registration** in `shortcut/mod.rs`:\r\n   - `register_dynamic_binding()` - idempotent (unregisters first if already registered)\r\n   - `unregister_dynamic_binding()` - removes binding at runtime\r\n   - `init_shortcuts()` skips dynamic bindings\r\n\r\n4. **Lifecycle**:\r\n   - `TranscribeAction::start()` registers cancel via `run_on_main_thread()`\r\n   - `TranscribeAction::stop()` unregisters cancel via `run_on_main_thread()`\r\n   - `CancelAction::start()` does NOT unregister (next registration handles cleanup)\r\n\r\n### Key design decisions\r\n\r\n**Why idempotent registration?**\r\n\r\nUnregistering from inside the shortcut's own callback causes a deadlock (global_shortcut holds internal locks). Instead, `register_dynamic_binding()` unregisters first, so `CancelAction` doesn't need to unregister itself.\r\n\r\n**Why release toggle lock before calling action?**\r\n\r\n`dispatch_binding_event()` releases the toggle state lock BEFORE calling `action.start()`/`stop()`. This prevents deadlock when `CancelAction` calls `cancel_current_operation()` which also needs the lock.\r\n\r\n## Linux Notes\r\n\r\nDynamic shortcut registration (used for the cancel shortcut) is **disabled on Linux** due to\r\ninstability with the `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` plugin. See PR #392.\r\n\r\nThis means the Escape-to-cancel feature is not available on Linux. The cancel shortcut will\r\nsilently be a no-op.\r\n\r\n**Potential future improvement:** The `dynamic` binding architecture in this branch provides\r\na cleaner foundation than the original async-spawn approach. If the underlying Linux shortcut\r\nissues are resolved upstream, enabling dynamic bindings on Linux would only require removing\r\nthe `#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]` guards in `register_dynamic_binding()` and\r\n`unregister_dynamic_binding()` in `shortcut/mod.rs`.\r\n\r\n## Reviewer Notes: fn Key UI\r\n\r\nThe fn key backend works regardless of UI changes. Users can always configure fn key manually\r\nby editing `settings_store.json`. Eg:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"bindings\": {\r\n      \"transcribe\": {\r\n        \"current_binding\": \"fn\",\r\n        \"default_binding\": \"option+space\",\r\n        \"description\": \"Converts your speech into text.\",\r\n        \"dynamic\": false,\r\n        \"id\": \"transcribe\",\r\n        \"name\": \"Transcribe\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### UI Visibility Option\r\n\r\nThe commit **\"Remove fn key UI (manual config only)\"** removes the \"Use fn\" button from the\r\nsettings UI. This commit is structured to be easily included or excluded:\r\n\r\n| Decision | Action |\r\n|----------|--------|\r\n| **Keep fn key as manual-config only** | Keep the commit as-is |\r\n| **Add \"Use fn\" button to UI** | Revert or drop the commit |\r\n\r\nThe UI additions that commit removes:\r\n- `isFnBinding()` helper function\r\n- \"Use fn\" button (shown on macOS when not already using fn)\r\n- \"fn (Globe)\" display text when fn is the current binding\r\n- Tooltip text explaining fn key usage\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reference PRs\r\n\r\n- [PR #136](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/136) - Original fn key implementation (tekacs)\r\n- [PR #224](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/224) - Cancel shortcut approach (jacksongoode)\r\n- [PR #392](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/392) - Disable cancel on Linux (stability fix)","closedAt":"2026-01-10T02:28:15Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Wc65D","author":{"login":"dannysmith"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@cjpais This is my attempt at #136 and #163 .\r\n\r\nCurrently it's settings-only (no UI changes) but if you recent the last commit there's a UI too.\r\n\r\nShout if you'd like me to change anything, and if you'd rather not merge this feel free to close - I need both `fn` and `Esc` working for Handy to be useful to me, and thought I might as well open an upstream PR 🙂","createdAt":"2025-12-01T17:31:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/401#issuecomment-3597905475","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7XK9ye","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"So I haven't had a ton of time to review, but just my overall comment is I really don't want any special case handling for the function key in an ideal world.

I would like to eventually move back to something like that, the main blocker on MacOS for that particular code was that it needed additional permissions when built which I do not want to give.

However, Wayland window managers handle focus changes asynchronously, meaning the previous application may not have regained focus by the time the paste operation is executed. This results in:\n\n- Text not appearing in the target application\n- Text being pasted into the overlay itself\n- Users needing to manually click the target window before paste works\n\n#### Solution\n\nIntroduces `hide_recording_overlay_with_callback()` which:\n1. Triggers the fade-out animation (300ms)\n2. Hides the overlay window\n3. Waits an additional 150ms for the window manager to restore focus\n4. Only then executes the paste operation via callback\n\nThis ensures reliable paste behavior across all Linux desktop environments, particularly on Wayland compositors.\n\n#### Technical Changes\n\n**`src-tauri/src/overlay.rs`:**\n- Added `hide_recording_overlay_with_callback<F>()` function with callback support\n- Comprehensive documentation explaining Wayland focus behavior\n\n**`src-tauri/src/actions.rs`:**\n- Updated `TranscribeAction::stop()` to use callback-based overlay hiding\n- Paste now executes only after overlay is fully hidden and focus restored\n\n#### Testing\n\nTested on:\n- Linux Mint (Cinnamon/X11)\n- Fedora (Wayland/GNOME)\n\n#### Related Issues\n\n- Fixes #315 - Typing fails due to target window not focused at correct time\n- Relates to #121 - Clipboard paste fails under Wayland\n- Relates to #193 - Handy steals focus on pressing hotkey\n\n","closedAt":"2026-02-12T07:57:50Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7WIWVU","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"So I've reviewed this briefly and also with the help of some large language models and I'm a bit skeptical to pull this in as is due to cross-platform concerns.

This is my first contribution to an open-source project on GitHub. I’m a big fan of Handy and saw a need for a feature to handle long-form recordings safely.\r\n\r\nI realized after working on this that there is an existing PR (https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/371) for file uploads, but I thought I would make this contribution anyway since this has a progress bar.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Context**\r\nThere is a significant need for this feature in the public sector, specifically for municipalities and government agencies (e.g., here in Sweden).\r\n\r\nCompliance & GDPR: Many organizations cannot use cloud-based transcription (which often costs ~$150/user/month) due to strict data compliance laws regarding sensitive meetings.\r\n\r\nLocal Processing: By keeping the file and transcription 100% local, Handy solves major legal hurdles regarding data transfer.\r\n\r\nEfficiency: Estimates in a small Swedish municipality suggest transcription (including sensitive meetings) could save around 5000 hours administrative hours annually. Yes, 5000 hours, not 500... for a municipality of around 60,000 citizens.\r\n\r\n**Technical Details**\r\nImplementation: This feature was built with the assistance of AI coding agents but has been manually reviewed and tested.\r\n\r\nTesting: Validated on a standard work laptop using the Parakeet V3 model. Successfully transcribed 20 and 40-minute files without memory spikes or crashes.\r\n\r\nI am happy to make changes or discuss how this might be merged or combined with existing efforts!\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nAdds the ability to import existing audio files (MP3, M4A, WAV) into Handy's history with automatic transcription. This feature includes real-time progress tracking, system notifications, and robust handling of long audio files using smart chunking (VAD).\r\n\r\nSuccessfully transcribed files are automatically moved to the \"Recordings\" folder for organization.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nUsers requested the ability to transcribe existing audio files, not just live recordings. This feature enables batch processing of pre-recorded audio while maintaining the same quality and privacy guarantees as live transcription.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\nCore Features\r\nFile Import: Native file picker for selecting MP3, M4A, and WAV files.\r\nSmart Chunking: Uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to split audio on silence, preventing words from being cut in half and improving transcription quality.\r\nProgress Tracking: Real-time progress bar showing transcription progress (0-100%).\r\nSystem Notifications: Desktop notifications on completion or failure.\r\nLong File Support: Prevents crashes on files >20 minutes by processing in chunks.\r\nAuto-Model Loading: Automatically loads the transcription model if it's not currently loaded.\r\nFile Management: Moves imported files to the \r\nrecordings\r\n folder after successful transcription.\r\nTechnical Implementation\r\nBackend (\r\nsrc-tauri/\r\n)\r\n\r\nAudio Processing: Added \r\ndecode_and_resample()\r\n using symphonia for multi-format support.\r\nSmart Chunking: Integrated \r\nSileroVad\r\n to detect silence windows around the target chunk size (30s) in \r\nTranscriptionManager\r\n.\r\nImport Workflow: New import_audio_file command handles decoding, resampling, smart chunking, transcription, and file management.\r\nEvents: Emits import-status and transcription-progress events for UI updates.\r\nDatabase: Updated HistoryManager to store audio duration.\r\n\r\n**Frontend** (src/)\r\nUI: Added \"Import Audio File\" button to History settings.\r\nFeedback: Implemented a progress bar component with percentage display.\r\nIntegration: Added event listeners for status updates and system notifications.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\nBackend: symphonia, tauri-plugin-notification, vad-rs\r\nFrontend: @tauri-apps/plugin-notification\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTested on Windows laptop with:\r\n\r\n✅ Short files (<1 min)\r\n✅ Medium files (5-10 min)\r\n✅ Long files (20+ min) - previously crashed, now works\r\n✅ All supported formats (MP3, M4A, WAV)\r\n✅ Model auto-loading and recovery if unloaded during transcription of long files\r\n✅ Progress bar\r\n✅ Notifications (success/failure)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"673\" height=\"596\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/993524b8-e589-403a-a756-8deb1d8b37db\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1227\" height=\"1002\" alt=\"Skärmbild 2025-11-25 181150\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54563f67-b73c-485e-a93e-a7921a96f601\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" height=\"805\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a74858af-b2a3-48f7-8c7d-b346bcc0fdf3\" />\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7VME0f","author":{"login":"Signal46"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Relates to https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/299","createdAt":"2025-11-25T17:21:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/381#issuecomment-3576712479","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7VMxjo","author":{"login":"olejsc"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" I notice this implements the actual *storage* of the file.

I think it would be useful to have support for multiple ways. However the way to achieve this could be different. Implementing the logic in a shell script could be more practical. For that purpose a \"hook script\" in Handy could be better so that anyone could tweak the logic to match their environment. For example, Wayland doesn't currently have a portable way to save the window which has focus and restore focus to this window later. PR #265 contains a way to handle this for Hyprland, but that's just one of the many compositors using Wayland.","createdAt":"2025-11-24T07:05:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/376#issuecomment-3569207711","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7VsjJ8","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Good with this, merging it.

So they understand exactly what the application does more immediately rather than having to intuit uh what it is.

I.e how to handle history entries for example, but also design liberties where the upload functionality should reside.  Feel free to adjust / correct it, this is just a Proof of concept really. \r\n- I tried as best as I can to avoid any new dependencies. Rodio which wraps around symphonia is used. The only new dependency is the dialogue file picker, which was needed to open the folders. \r\n- **NOT tested on MacOS** ( I dont own one..) \r\n- File limit set to 64 mb for the time beeing\r\n- A copy of the file is *NOT* made for the time beeing, so it does not get copied to the recordings folder, but instead the database gets a path to the file being transcribed. \r\n   - If file is missing from its path, we cannot playback it (disabled playback button). The transcribed text remains in history though.\r\n   - Audio recordings now have a microphone icon on their history entry, while manual file uploads have a document icon ( + tooltip)\r\n- Im unsure how it would handle if you were to start another transcribing (with microphone) while it is processing a file. Edge cases are plenty I suspect. 🤔\r\n- I think i managed to keep post processing functionality working with it, as it just re-uses existing post processing logic. \r\n- Existing logic for what to do with the transcription when its done should remain identical (copy/paste + storing in history). \r\n- AI helped me quite a far bit with this. 7-9 chats with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n# **Core Features:**\r\n\r\n- Users can now upload audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, AAC) through a new UploadAudioButton component\r\n- Backend transcribe_file command handles the full transcription pipeline: decode → transcribe → post-process → save → paste\r\n- New decode_audio_file function converts various audio formats to 16kHz mono PCM samples using the rodio decoder\r\n\r\n\r\n## **History System Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Added source_file_path column to distinguish between uploaded files and mic recordings\r\n- Uploaded files reference the original source file instead of creating WAV copies\r\n- File existence checks prevent playback errors for missing uploaded files\r\n- UI shows icons (FileText vs Mic) and warnings for missing source files\r\n\r\n\r\n## **User Interface:**\r\n\r\n- Upload button integrated into History Settings with loading states and error handling\r\n- Real-time event system for transcription status (file-transcription-started, completed, failed)\r\n- Audio player component supports disabled state for missing files\r\n\r\n## **Technical Details:**\r\n\r\n- Uses tauri-plugin-dialog for file picker integration\r\n- File validation: 64MB size limit, supported format checking\r\n- Full post-processing pipeline support (LLM, Chinese variant conversion)\r\n- Database migration to v4 for new schema\r\n- The feature maintains parity with regular recordings - uploaded files receive the same post-processing and are saved to history, but skip WAV duplication to avoid unnecessary storage.\r\n\r\nGif demo:\r\n![demo-file-upload-audio-file-transcribe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/690cfae3-a82c-4fc8-8e8f-00ea5d2ea0d1)\r\n","closedAt":"2025-11-28T00:49:04Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Umzrb","author":{"login":"olejsc"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One more thing; I'm not sure how it fares with different audio formats.

Similarly, the overlay is not shown when the user switches spaces (#278).\r\n\r\nOn macOS Big Sur+, standard `NSWindow` with `.always_on_top(true)` uses `NSFloatingWindowLevel` (level 3). Fullscreen apps run at `NSMainMenuWindowLevel + 1` (level 25+), so standard windows appear **behind** fullscreen content.\r\n\r\n**Relevant Tauri Issues:**\r\n\r\n- [Show window on top of full-screen app #5793](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5793)\r\n- [visibleOnAllWorkspaces not working with fullscreen #11488](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11488)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nUse NSPanel instead of NSWindow. Only `NSPanel` windows can appear above fullscreen apps.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nUses [tauri-nspanel](https://github.com/ahkohd/tauri-nspanel) plugin (v2.1), which seems to be the best option here. [Cap](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap) and [Overlayed](https://github.com/overlayeddev/overlayed) both use it in prod, and any other options add significantly more macOS-specific code.\r\n\r\nOnly `create_recording_overlay()` needs to be platform-conditional. Other overlay functions (`show`, `hide`, `update_position`, etc.) can remain platform-agnostic because `PanelBuilder` creates a standard Tauri window first, **then converts it to NSPanel** — the window remains registered in Tauri's manager, accessible via `get_webview_window()`.\r\n\r\nThe NSPanel has:\r\n\r\n- High window level (`PanelLevel::Status` - level 25)\r\n- `canJoinAllSpaces` - appears in all Mission Control spaces\r\n- `fullScreenAuxiliary` - works alongside fullscreen apps\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added tauri-nspanel dependency for macOS builds\r\n2. `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Initialize plugin on macOS\r\n3. `src-tauri/src/overlay.rs` - Platform-conditional panel creation\r\n\r\n- No frontend changes – React/CSS overlay components untouched.\r\n- `macOSPrivateApi: true` required in `tauri.conf.json` (this was already enabled)\r\n\r\n## What I've tested\r\n\r\nBuild tested on macOS Tahoe 26.0.1 (Apple Silicon):\r\n\r\n- [x] Works accross fullscreen apps (closes #277)\r\n- [x] Works when switching spaces while recording overlay is active (closes #278)\r\n- [x] No changes to existing UI or behavior (that I could find at least)\r\n\r\n## What I can't test\r\n\r\n- [ ] Builds for Win/Linux still work fine\r\n- [ ] Signed builds for macOS actually work (coz urgh Tauri can sometimes be annoying here)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [tauri-nspanel documentation](https://github.com/ahkohd/tauri-nspanel)\r\n- [macOS Window Levels](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowlevel)\r\n- [NSWindow.CollectionBehavior](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/collectionbehavior)\r\n- [Stack Overflow: NSPanel above fullscreen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36205834/allow-an-nswindow-nspanel-to-float-above-full-screen-apps)\r\n","closedAt":"2025-11-20T03:28:15Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7T5XK6","author":{"login":"dannysmith"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Also...\r\n\r\n1.

I implemented most of this PR with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and it works consistently in my testing.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nI'm on Hyprland (Wayland) and ran into two major issues:\r\n1. **Global keyboard shortcuts don't work** - Wayland handles shortcuts differently than X11\r\n2. **Chrome ignores the transcription** - Chrome/Chromium on Wayland blocks synthetic keyboard input for security, so even when transcription completed, nothing would paste into the browser\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\n### D-Bus Interface\r\n\r\nAdded a D-Bus service so you can trigger transcription via system commands instead of global shortcuts:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Start transcription\r\nbusctl --user call com.pais.Handy /com/pais/Handy com.pais.Handy.Transcription StartTranscription\r\n\r\n# Stop transcription  \r\nbusctl --user call com.pais.Handy /com/pais/Handy com.pais.Handy.Transcription StopTranscription\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can bind these to keys in your Hyprland config:\r\n```conf\r\nbind = SUPER, R, exec, busctl --user call com.pais.Handy /com/pais/Handy com.pais.Handy.Transcription StartTranscription\r\nbindrt = SUPER, R, exec, busctl --user call com.pais.Handy /com/pais/Handy com.pais.Handy.Transcription StopTranscription\r\n```\r\n\r\n### wtype Integration for Chrome\r\n\r\nChrome blocks synthetic input from libraries like `enigo`, so I added support for `wtype` (a Wayland-native text input tool). When you set the paste method to \"Direct Input\" in settings, it automatically uses `wtype` on Wayland, which Chrome trusts.\r\n\r\nInstall with: `sudo pacman -S wtype` (or your distro's equivalent)\r\n\r\n### Focus Handling\r\n\r\nThe app now captures which window has focus before showing the overlay, then restores it before pasting. This ensures the text goes to the right place (using `hyprctl` for Hyprland).\r\n\r\n## What Changed\r\n\r\n- **New files**: \r\n  - `src-tauri/src/dbus.rs` - D-Bus interface implementation\r\n  \r\n- **Modified files**:\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/clipboard.rs` - Added wtype support\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/overlay.rs` - Added focus capture/restore\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` - Calls focus restoration before pasting\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/shortcut.rs` - Detects Wayland and disables shortcuts\r\n  - `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Initializes D-Bus service\r\n  - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added zbus dependencies\r\n\r\n## Automatic Behavior\r\n\r\nThe app automatically:\r\n- Detects Wayland sessions (via `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` env var)\r\n- Disables keyboard shortcuts on Wayland (they don't work anyway)\r\n- Shows helpful log messages about using D-Bus instead\r\n- Uses `wtype` when available and on Wayland\r\n\r\nOn X11, everything works exactly as before - no changes to the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n## Question for Maintainer\r\n\r\nI'm disabling the old keybinding system on Wayland since I'm pretty sure they don't work for anyone on Wayland (that's the whole reason I needed D-Bus). But I'm not 100% certain - it could just be my setup. Let me know if you think this should be optional instead of automatic!\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested on Arch Linux with Hyprland. Works consistently with:\r\n- VSCode ✅\r\n- Discord ✅  \r\n- Chrome/Chromium ✅ (with wtype)","closedAt":"2025-11-28T02:25:20Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Ol2wJ","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Wow big thank you for this!

And to be fair, I guess this is largely the case already. I think it would probably make sense to have some kind of idle state, potentially. And quite frankly, the status of the model is not very well unified between the backend and front end, and maybe there's a bit of help there that could be done just so it's a bit more consistent and represents the state properly everywhere. I'm not really sure how well the code will support that. I think the idle state could be green potentially as well. Cause the app more or less should be ready. I also think generally the status right now now displayed in the UI is not super clear and maybe needs to be removed overall. Mainly because there is already an unload model function, and I don't believe the UI is paying attention to when the model is actually unloaded. So there's already a desync of the state already. \r\n\r\nSo this is really all to say. I'm not super concerned about the regression right now. However, if we could mark it as green for the time being, that would be great. And if you have any other thoughts on this state stuff overall, I'd be really, really happy to hear what you think might be an appropriate way forwards. Even if it comes in another PR, that's totally fine. I also don't know if you have any thoughts on how the model selector generally could be modified or made more user friendly in any ways, or if it's good enough as is. It didn't receive a lot of time and focus when it was initially implemented, and the whole thing is kind of a bodge.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm sorry I've merged some more of the code in this area, it probably needs a rebase again. I may get on with the 0.5.2 release and then stage this for 0.5.3.

The existing paste logic was hard-coded to “Cmd/Ctrl+V” using literal keycodes, which breaks\r\non non-QWERTY layouts (Dvorak, AZERTY, etc.). To make a user-configurable binding actually work, we needed three changes:\r\n\r\n- Frontend capture: The settings component must read actual key events, normalize them across platforms, show the recorded combo, and reset/cancel cleanly. That’s why PasteShortcut.tsx includes the\r\nevent handlers, refs, OS detection, and display formatting.\r\n- Keyboard utilities: The prior helpers relied on event.code, which always reports the physical key (QWERTY assumption). We switched to layout-aware event.key, added normalization, and kept\r\nformatting consistent, so recording “Cmd+,” on Dvorak doesn’t display as “Cmd+V”.\r\n- Backend parsing: The Tauri side still needs to send the recorded combo to Enigo. That required parsing the stored string into modifiers + trigger key, validation, and a fallback to the default\r\ncombo if a custom one fails. Without reworking clipboard.rs, the UI change wouldn’t actually paste correctly.\r\n\r\nSo while the UI addition is just one row in Settings, making it dependable for any layout meant refactoring both capture and send paths.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/93","closedAt":"2025-10-08T19:36:48Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7IWZ1W","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I'll take a look next week and see.

This is similar to #136. See the discussion there. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell. I am hesitant to pull these changes in because I believe it requires an extra permission on MacOS. I originally used `rdev` across the app instead of Tauri's Global Shortcut because Global Shortcut does not allow as many key combinations. But the problem with `rdev` is that it requires an extra permission which I am not super fond of that particular permission (I believe it is full keyboard access). There are other apps that are able to use the fn key without this permission so I think that should be our target for merge. I am not sure this is possible at the moment, but I think it's worth investigating to know for certain.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that that permission probably doesn't show up in the dev env (at least it didn't for me) so you may need to `tauri build` to see it. Let me know if it works without this permission I will gladly give it a try and pull if it does work nicely.\r\n\r\nIdeally we also should have a single unified way of keyboard shortcut detection, and if that means moving away from Global Shortcut, I am happy to do that.

Or some things I have questions about.\r\n\r\nMainly, I think the size on disk and delete history button probably should be removed. Mainly because you're really never going to get more than five history messages ever in the current implementation. If we change the setting so that you can customize the history size, then it might make sense to have that button. However, I think we can just put a little X next to each individual history item itself. To me, this seems like a much cleaner UI and leaves it much less cluttered.\r\n\r\nI also think that the enable history setting either should be in advanced. And perhaps the history tab disappears entirely if the history setting itself is disabled. \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to add a note in the history bit itself, probably italicized, that the history only saves the five most recent transcriptions. I am not sure how best to display this. I bet it could probably just be some light gray text that's italicized at the top describing how the history feature works. But again, I'm a little concerned about how it clutters the UI, so just keeping the UI fairly clean is most important here. Maybe it is on the same level of the history label itself and pushed off to the right side of the page. I don't know if that would work or not, but maybe it does.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess my overall question is why do you want to disable the history? I personally would prefer not to have an additional setting because I think it just clutters the UI and gives too much option to the user. It's not clear to me why it would really need to be disabled, but perhaps that's just my opinion.

I thought it was maybe because the model got unloaded from Handy, but I tried to set it to unload the model immediately and the bug is still there. I think task manager might block inputs from going to handy because the push to talk shortcut doesn't work either while task manager is open.  \n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** 0.7.7\n\n<!-- You can find this in the app settings or about section -->\n\n**Operating System:** Windows 11\n\nOS Name\tMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\nVersion\t10.0.22631 Build 22631\nSystem Manufacturer\tASUS\nSystem Type\tx64-based PC\nProcessor\tAMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 3401 Mhz, 16 Core(s), 32 Logical Processor(s)\nBIOS Version/Date\tAmerican Megatrends Inc. 3611, 9/29/2024\nSMBIOS Version\t3.3\nEmbedded Controller Version\t255.255\nBIOS Mode\tUEFI\nBaseBoard Manufacturer\tASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.\nBaseBoard Product\tPRIME B550-PLUS\nBaseBoard Version\tRev X.0x\nPlatform Role\tDesktop\nSecure Boot State\tOff\nHardware Abstraction Layer\tVersion = \"10.0.22621.2506\"\nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM)\t128 GB\nTotal Physical Memory\t128 GB\nAvailable Physical Memory\t76.2 GB\nTotal Virtual Memory\t136 GB\nAvailable Virtual Memory\t71.2 GB\nPage File Space\t8.00 GB\nKernel DMA Protection\tOff\nVirtualization-based security\tRunning\nVirtualization-based security Required Security Properties\t\nVirtualization-based security Available Security Properties\tBase Virtualization Support, DMA Protection, UEFI Code Readonly, SMM Security Mitigations 1.0, Mode Based Execution Control\nVirtualization-based security Services Configured\tHypervisor enforced Code Integrity\nVirtualization-based security Services Running\tHypervisor enforced Code Integrity\nWindows Defender Application Control policy\tEnforced\nWindows Defender Application Control user mode policy\tOff\nDevice Encryption Support\tElevation Required to View\nA hypervisor has been detected.

They would need to manually uninstall the MSI version and reinstall using the NSIS installer once. There is no automatic migration path due to Tauri's updater selecting the installer type based on the bundle type embedded at compile time. This should affect a small number of users since the MSI installer requires admin rights and most users install via the NSIS `setup.exe`.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** 0.7.5 → 0.7.7 (via OTA)\n\n**Operating System:** Windows 11\n\n**CPU:** x64\n\n**GPU:** N/A","closedAt":"2026-02-21T14:45:39Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qxs0Q","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"This is #159, however thank you for looking into it.

If any single event is missed or duplicated, the state permanently inverts - the library thinks ctrl is held when it isn't (or vice versa).\n> \n> Events can be missed when:\n> \n> 1. kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout — macOS disables event taps if the callback takes too long. The library's _ => {} wildcard at line 299 silently ignores this, with no code to re-enable the tap. While disabled, modifier events are lost.\n> 2. App focus transitions / system interrupts — screen lock, fast user switching, Mission Control, or other system events can cause missed FlagsChanged events.\n> 3. Rapid key combinations — pressing/releasing modifiers quickly during callback processing could cause event coalescence.\n> \n> Once CTRL_LEFT gets stuck in current_modifiers, every bare spacebar press matches the ctrl+space hotkey. Restarting the app resets the internal state, which explains why that fixes it temporarily.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:**\n\n- v0.7.6\n- Has been occurring since v0.7.5 I think, _maybe_ v0.7.4\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nMacOS 26.3\n\n**CPU:**\n\nM2 Max\n\n**GPU:**\n\nM2 Max\n","closedAt":"2026-02-20T06:36:13Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7qT_sW","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Yeah the upstream handy keys definitely broke some stuff.

It works fine after a fresh app launch but eventually stops firing entirely, requiring a restart to recover. This happens regardless of which key combination is configured and persists across full settings resets and even a complete wipe of the app data directory.\n\nI initially thought updating to v0.7.5 resolved it, but the problem has returned.\n\nI've also been running dev builds locally, but with a different app identifier so the dev and production instances use separate data directories. It's unlikely that's a factor, but worth noting.\n\nI suspect this was introduced by the handy-keys upgrade from 0.1.4 to 0.2.0 in commit 624579e. The problem seems related to how modifier state is tracked internally in the newer version, which can get out of sync with the actual keyboard state.\n\n## AI's research\n\nIn handy-keys 0.1.4, modifier state was read directly from `CGEventFlags` on every event via `flags_to_modifiers(flags)`, keeping it always accurate. In 0.2.0, modifier state is tracked manually in `state.current_modifiers` by toggling bits on each `FlagsChanged` event. If any modifier event is missed (e.g., macOS temporarily disabling the CGEventTap due to callback latency), the internal state permanently desyncs and shortcuts stop matching. Additionally, the `TapDisabledByTimeout` event type is silently ignored in a catch-all `_ => {}` branch in `listener.rs`, so a disabled tap is never re-enabled. A possible fix would be to reconcile `current_modifiers` against the actual `CGEventFlags` on every event, or to handle `TapDisabledByTimeout` by re-enabling the tap.\n\nRef: handy-computer/handy-keys@0.1.4...0.2.0","closedAt":"2026-02-20T06:37:02Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7pTUbE","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@arunsathiya I've been getting some odd behavior as well.

There is zero visual feedback.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Connect two or more monitors (primary + at least one secondary)\n2. On the primary monitor, focus an input field and press the transcribe shortcut → overlay displays normally ✅\n3. Switch to a secondary monitor and open any application with an input field\n4. Focus the input field on the secondary monitor and press the transcribe shortcut\n\n**Expected:** Overlay appears on the secondary monitor (the monitor currently in use)\n**Actual:** No overlay is displayed on any monitor (no visual feedback whatsoever)\n\n**Note:** Speech recognition and text insertion work correctly — transcribed text is properly inserted into the input field on the secondary monitor.

The `direct` method uses `wtype` (an external process), and `none` skips pasting entirely — neither use enigo for the paste step, and neither exhibit the stall.\n\nThe stall pattern suggests enigo's X11 keyboard simulation on Wayland interferes with the TranscriptionManager's internal state, possibly through:\n- Blocking or contending on a shared resource (mutex, condvar) during key simulation\n- The X11 connection state interfering with the signal handler or event loop\n- A timing interaction between enigo's key release events and the idle watcher thread\n\n## Additional Context: `direct` (wtype) is also broken\n\nSeparately, `paste_method: \"direct\"` (wtype v0.4-3) outputs raw keycodes instead of text characters on updated Wayland compositors. This is caused by a Smithay regression ([Smithay#1926](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/issues/1926)) where the compositor's virtual keyboard handler uses the seat's keymap instead of the virtual keyboard's custom keymap. A fix is in progress ([Smithay PR #1903](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/pull/1903)).\n\nThis affects cosmic-comp ([pop-os/cosmic-comp#2081](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/issues/2081)) and niri ([niri#2314](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/issues/2314)). wtype itself is unmaintained since 2022 ([wtype#71](https://github.com/atx/wtype/issues/71)).\n\nThis means **no paste method currently works correctly on affected Wayland compositors** — enigo-based methods stall the app, and wtype outputs garbage.\n\n## Workaround\n\nSetting `paste_method: \"none\"` with `clipboard_handling: \"copy_to_clipboard\"` avoids all issues. Transcribed text is correctly copied to the Wayland clipboard via `wl-copy`, and the user can paste manually with Ctrl+Shift+V.\n\n## Suggested Fix Directions\n\n- Investigate why enigo's X11 key simulation on Wayland causes TranscriptionManager stalls — possibly a threading/locking issue\n- Consider adding `ydotool` or `dotool` (kernel uinput-based) as paste method alternatives that bypass both enigo and Wayland protocol issues\n- Consider `libei`/`eitype` as a future-forward Wayland-native input emulation path (once compositor support matures)\n- The wtype/direct paste issue will resolve upstream once Smithay PR #1903 is merged and compositors update","closedAt":"2026-02-17T05:05:43Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7nWc5U","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"> Consider adding ydotool or dotool (kernel uinput-based) as paste method alternatives that bypass both enigo and Wayland protocol issues\n\nboth are supported already\n\n#760 might help\n\n> Consider libei/eitype as a future-forward Wayland-native input emulation path (once compositor support matures)\n\nyes definitely","createdAt":"2026-02-11T00:17:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/779#issuecomment-3881422420","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7oDakt","author":{"login":"arimxyer"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, sweet.

However, the signal handler in `signal_handle.rs` still only maps `SIGUSR2` to `\"transcribe\"`. There is no signal-based way to trigger `transcribe_with_post_process`.\n\n## Use Case\n\nOn Linux desktop environments where Tauri's global shortcut capture doesn't work reliably (e.g., Pop!_OS, certain GNOME/Wayland setups), users rely on system-level custom keyboard shortcuts that send `pkill -SIGUSR2 -x handy` to trigger transcription. This is also the approach documented in the README for Sway and the approach taken by PR #572 for Wayland/GNOME integration.\n\nCurrently, these users can only trigger basic transcription via signal. There is no way to trigger `transcribe_with_post_process` externally, since no second signal is registered.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd `SIGUSR1` handling in `signal_handle.rs`, mapped to `\"transcribe_with_post_process\"`:\n\n- `SIGUSR1` → `\"transcribe_with_post_process\"` (transcription + AI post-processing)\n- `SIGUSR2` → `\"transcribe\"` (basic transcription, unchanged)\n\nThis mirrors the existing `SIGUSR2` implementation pattern and would allow users to set up two system-level shortcuts:\n\n```\n# Basic transcription\npkill -SIGUSR2 -x handy\n\n# Transcription with post-processing\npkill -SIGUSR1 -x handy\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis would also benefit PR #572 (Wayland/GNOME system shortcuts), which currently only configures `SIGUSR2` for basic transcription.","closedAt":"2026-02-10T04:03:41Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7m-sK8","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Let's just keep this to the PR.

At 16kHz mono, `sample_count / 16000` should approximately equal the elapsed time between `TranscribeAction::start` and `TranscribeAction::stop`. In practice, 1-3 seconds of audio are routinely lost from the end of the recording, causing the transcription to miss the last few words spoken before the key is released.\n\n## Evidence from logs\n\nAll times taken from Handy's own debug log:\n\n| Wall time (s) | Samples | Audio duration (s) | Lost (s) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 5 | 57,600 | 3.60 | 1.4 |\n| 9 | 127,680 | 7.98 | 1.0 |\n| 12 | 130,080 | 8.13 | 3.9 |\n| 15 | 199,200 | 12.45 | 2.6 |\n| 6 | 74,400 | 4.65 | 1.4 |\n| 13 | 188,160 | 11.76 | 1.2 |\n| 7 | 67,200 | 4.20 | 2.8 |\n\nThe loss is variable but almost always positive and affects the tail of the recording — the last words spoken before releasing the push-to-talk key are not included in the transcription.\n\n## Suspected cause\n\nAudio samples that are in-flight between the last PipeWire buffer delivery and the moment `TranscribeAction::stop` halts the microphone stream are being discarded. The stream appears to stop immediately rather than draining remaining buffered audio.\n\nReducing PipeWire's `default.clock.quantum` from 1024 to 128 mitigates the issue (smaller buffers = less data in-flight at stop time) but does not fully resolve it.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe stop operation should drain any remaining buffered audio before finalizing the sample buffer that is passed to the transcription model.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** v0.7.1 (handy-bin AUR)\n**Operating System:** Arch Linux, kernel 6.18.7-arch1-1\n**Audio:** PipeWire 1.4.9, AMD ACP6.3 DMIC (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 5)\n**CPU:** AMD (8 cores)\n**Model:** Parakeet v3 (also reproduced with Whisper Turbo)","closedAt":"2026-02-20T06:36:37Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7lZmu8","author":{"login":"mjesuele"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"## Update: confirmed this is a Handy audio capture bug, not a PipeWire or model issue\n\nAfter further investigation, we can confirm the issue is in Handy's audio capture code, not the system audio stack or the transcription model.\n\n### Evidence\n\n**1. Handy's saved WAV files are already corrupted before reaching the model:**\n- Listening to the WAV files in `~/.local/share/com.pais.handy/recordings/` reveals that the audio itself contains stutters (duplicate audio segments) and is truncated at the end.\n- The end-of-recording beep is not present in the saved WAV file, suggesting the stream is being cut short before the stop signal completes.\n- Word repetitions in transcription output (e.g., \"correct correctly\", \"w worth\") are caused by the model hearing duplicated audio, not a decoder issue.\n\n**2. `pw-record` at identical settings produces clean audio:**\n- `pw-record --rate 16000 --channels 1 --format f32` captures audio with no stutters, no clipping, and no sample loss — even during long recordings with fast speech and while other audio-producing applications are running.\n- Same microphone, same sample rate, same format, same PipeWire session.\n\n**3. PipeWire is not dropping samples:**\n- A timed 5-second `pw-record` capture produced 5.86 seconds of audio (the overshoot is from process start/stop timing), confirming zero sample loss at the system level.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issue is in Handy's audio stream handling — likely how it buffers incoming samples from the audio backend and how it drains/finalizes the buffer on stop. The system audio stack (PipeWire 1.4.10, AMD ACP6.3 DMIC) is working correctly.\n\n### System info\n\n- Handy v0.7.1 (AUR handy-bin)\n- Arch Linux, kernel 6.18.7\n- PipeWire 1.4.10\n- Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 5, AMD ACP6.3 DMIC","createdAt":"2026-02-04T17:12:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/709#issuecomment-3848694716","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7lZoJR","author":{"login":"mjesuele"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"By the way — really appreciate the work on Handy.

no need for a full D-Bus round trip per line\n- Removed `--trim-newline` from `wl-copy` — redundant since `printf %s` never appends a newline\n- Warning message moved to stderr","createdAt":"2026-02-22T13:22:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/684#issuecomment-3940942141","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-29T08:10:33Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":684,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] German umlauts are not printed"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDc3NjQ3","is_bot":false,"login":"nicolasmol","name":"NicolasMol76"},"body":"v0.7.0 linux mint 22.3 cinnamon, laptop HP Probook  with i7:\nParakeet V3 :  Speaking in French, it often translates into English.\nIt is a great pity that we cannot find a way to force it to a specific language rather than having it try to guess it.","closedAt":"2026-01-27T17:40:36Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7i46j7","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Parakeet doesn't support this, I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it.

Seems like it is just an issue with the UI not the actual program execution, but I haven't tested since it involves an option I do not normally use.\n\n# Bug Description\n\nWhen opening the handy settings screen and clicking on the advanced section, There's a toggle for experimental features. Upon toggling that switch, the experimental section appears at the bottom, but nothing else changes. If you then toggle post processing within the experimental section, a new tab appears on the left, below advanced, called post process.\n\nIf you then disable experimental features, the experimental section with the post processing toggle disappears, but the post process tab stays there on the sidebar. This can lead to an issue where someone is unable to turn off post processing because they don't realize the toggle was hidden in the experimental section not in the post process tab, and the post process tab only contains the settings and configuration, not an on off switch.\n\nThis could potentially also cause confusion about whether or not post-processing is active because the post-process toggle can be on while invisible with its parent toggle for the experimental section turned off.\n\nI would personally expect disabling experimental features to automatically disable post processing along with all other experimental features, but because the post process toggle was still on making the post process tab still visible, I am not sure if it is actually active without testing the output to check for post processing, and if the post processing is minor or subtle that could be difficult as well.\n\n# System Information\n\n**App Version:**\n\n0.7.0\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nEndeavorOS - KDE Plasma - X11  (all up to date)\n\n**CPU:**\n\nAMD 2700x\n\n**GPU:**\n\nAMD RX580\n","closedAt":"2026-01-25T00:49:43Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7iPugS","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thank you and yes I agree it is in a pretty weird spot and can be unexpected.

Version 0.6.10 seems to work. But it only accepts the Parakeet (V3) Model. I can download Whisper Models (like \"medium\" or \"turbo\"), but whenever I try to load one of them, Handy starts loading and crashes after a certain time - looks to me when it changes to this model. I got 32 GB of RAM, so that shouldn't be an issue.\nI even tried to change the model-name in the \"settings-store\" file to a whisper model, so the app would load the right model on startup. But then it starts with \"model unloaded\" and crashes the same, when I choose a whisper model. \n\n## System Information\n\n0.6.10\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nopenSUSE Tumbleweed, KDE Plasma 6.5.4, KDE FW 6.21.0, Qt 6.10.1, Kernel 6.18.2-1\n\n**CPU:**\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 5700G\n\n**GPU:**\n\nAMD Radeon Graphics (integrated)","closedAt":"2026-01-10T23:41:51Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7ei4mp","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"This is a duplicate of many other issues, but crashing on whisper is known and I'm really trying to solve it.","createdAt":"2026-01-10T23:41:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/563#issuecomment-3733686697","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2026-01-10T17:17:16Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":563,"state":"CLOSED","title":"[BUG]  Handy crashes under Linux when changing Model"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjI1OTAw","is_bot":false,"login":"thiswillbeyourgithub","name":"Olivier Cornelis"},"body":"\n\n## Bug Description\n\nI am using a work windows machine I don't have admin rights on.\nI can't install handy with the .msi file because it asks for admin rights.\nI can install it with the setup.exe file however.\nBut when a new version gets released, if I click on the lower right update button, the way it tried to update itself ends up asking for an admin password.\nSo I end up downloading the .exe myself and updating by hand.\nNot a huuuuge problem but intractable for newbies at work I'm trying to put onboard.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n1.

To enable non-admin installs and fix the update loop (Issue #562):\n\n- Update tauri.conf.json: Add \"installScope\": \"perUser\" to the Windows bundle configuration.\n\n- Check AllowElevation: Ensure it's set to false in the WiX settings.\n\n- Registry: Since you use tauri-plugin-autostart, it already targets HKCU. The admin prompt only appears because the MSI itself is flagged as perMachine by default.\n\n\nThis change will allow the app to be installed and updated entirely within the user's %LOCALAPPDATA% without ever triggering a UAC prompt.\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n😯","createdAt":"2026-01-16T14:03:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/562#issuecomment-3760169354","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7gIZEI","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"possibly related [#13792](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13792), the LLM's are good for a lot, but around these weird tauri stuff, actual search + LLM is going to be much more helpful. there's just really not enough training data on tauri specifically to be accurate enough given its quite new. especially with tauri v2, which the llm can't often disambiguate from v1 in my experience","createdAt":"2026-01-16T14:34:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/562#issuecomment-3760296200","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2026-01-10T09:45:41Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":562,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] install with .exe cannot update itself without admin rights"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOC47AUw","is_bot":false,"login":"Alexis-Loskoutoff","name":""},"body":"Hey !

(So, if you're ok with AI, I'd recommend \"debugging\" with AI guidance on this maybe).\n\nFrom memory, some of what needed to be done:\n\nThe CPU lacked AVX instructions (?), so it needed to swap npm for bun in installation files. \n\nIn the tauri.config.json file I switched \"npm\" for \"bun\" in two commands:\n\n```\n\"beforeDevCommand\": \"bun run dev\",\n\"beforeBuildCommand\": \"bun run build\"\n```\n\n(npm run dev and npm run build?)\n\n(AI suggests I installed dependencies, for example:)\n\n```\nsudo apt install \\\n  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \\\n  build-essential \\\n  curl \\\n  wget \\\n  file \\\n  libssl-dev \\\n  libgtk-3-dev \\\n  librsvg2-dev\n```\n\nI think I ultimately ran \"npx tauri dev\" to compile (in what directory? the main one? I forget)\n\nThe final result runs two separate commands in /Handy/src/tauri-/target/debug: \n\n1 \"npm run dev\" to start the server; \n\n2 \"./handy\" to start the app.\n\nSorry I didn't log things as I go; hope this helps someone debug their issues if they had similar causes to their issue.","createdAt":"2026-01-16T19:28:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/554#issuecomment-3761483647","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7koRmr","author":{"login":"ltpitt"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Same problem here!\ni5 first gen, modern linux:\nIllegal instruction (core dumped)","createdAt":"2026-02-02T15:15:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/554#issuecomment-3835763115","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-08T12:48:19Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":554,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] Handy doesn't launch due to illegal instruction"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMxNjc=","is_bot":false,"login":"jeanmatthieud","name":"Jean-Matthieu DECHRISTÉ"},"body":"## Bug Description\n\nI have an Azerty keyboard and Windows 11 (and Windows is currently configured to use the french layout*.\nWhen I click on the box to choose the shortcut to start the recording, and press a key, the displayed key is the one of the Qwerty layout and not the Azerty layout.\n\nFor exemple:\n- When I press \"A\" on the french keyboard, it configures it as \"Q\"\n\n*) Please note that I have multiple keyboards configured on my Windows 11 (I can change with Win+space), as my laptop have a physical Qwerty keyboard, and I have a logitech MX Keys Azerty keyboard.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** v0.6.10\n\n**Operating System:** Windows 11\n\n**CPU:** 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11370H @ 3.30GHz (3.30 GHz)\n\n**GPU:** Intel UHD Graphics\n","closedAt":"2026-01-08T09:27:44Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7d6C31","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Duplicate of #96","createdAt":"2026-01-08T09:27:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/553#issuecomment-3722980853","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7d7Fqx","author":{"login":"jeanmatthieud"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Sorry, I didn't saw this issue","createdAt":"2026-01-08T10:38:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/553#issuecomment-3723254449","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7d-av6","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"No worries!","createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:28:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/553#issuecomment-3724127226","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2026-01-08T09:13:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":553,"state":"CLOSED","title":"[BUG] Shortcut configuration only works with Qwerty layout"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOB1YF4w","is_bot":false,"login":"qunt777777","name":""},"body":"## Before You Submit\n\n**Please search [existing issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues) to avoid duplicates.** Your bug may already be reported!

Granting write access to global input devices effectively reintroduces unrestricted input injection for all processes owned by the user, which increases the attack surface and bypasses Wayland’s isolation guarantees.\n\nFrom a security perspective, this is exactly the class of issues Wayland was designed to prevent. If these constraints are not critical in your use case, it may be more coherent to use a more permissive environment such as X11 rather than weakening Wayland’s security model to recover legacy behavior.\n\nI am working on an alternative approach that stays within Wayland’s intended boundaries by using the GNOME Remote Desktop portal, which is currently the only official channel allowing compositor-mediated input injection. This portal does not establish any remote connection; this is worth clarifying, as the name can be counter-intuitive. It is only used to allow Handy to inject keyboard events locally after explicit user authorization.\n\nDetails are available here: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/689\n\nThis provides a Wayland-native option aligned with the platform’s security philosophy, without relying on privilege escalation.","createdAt":"2026-01-30T22:52:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/522#issuecomment-3826201693","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-04T11:30:38Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":522,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] wtype failures seem silently ignored"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTY5","is_bot":false,"login":"dandv","name":"Dan Dascalescu"},"body":"## Bug Description\n\nOn KDE Wayland/Ubuntu 24.04, for both \"Microphone\" and \"Output Device\", Handy v0.6.10 only shows \"Default\" when more than one recoding/playback device exists:\n\n<img width=\"494\" height=\"211\" alt=\"Handy screenshot\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5adaafb4-c62e-4b5b-816a-fd1e4bb938a9\" />\n\nBoth recording and playback work, but it seems impossible to select between the internal microphone and a Bluetooth-connected headset.\n\nRelevant logs:\n\n```\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM pipewire\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM pipewire\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM pulse\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM pulse\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM jack\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM jack\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM oss\nALSA lib pcm.c:2721:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM oss\n```\n\nIn KDE, System Settings -> Sound, I do see \"Built-in Analog Stereo\" and my Airpods Pro connected over Bluetooth:\n\n<img width=\"959\" height=\"823\" alt=\"KDE Sound\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc3f522-5c03-41c9-9d36-a57ba3a01525\" />\n\nDebug info:\n\n```sh\n$ arecord -l\n**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC256 Analog [ALC256 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n$ aplay -l\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC256 Analog [ALC256 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 9: HDMI 3 [HDMI 3]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n$ pactl list sources short\n55      alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor      PipeWire        s32le 2ch 48000Hz       SUSPENDED\n56      alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo       PipeWire        s32le 2ch 48000Hz       SUSPENDED\n7960    bluez_output.04_9D_05_91_04_55.1.monitor        PipeWire        s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED\n7968    bluez_input.04:9D:05:91:04:55   PipeWire        float32le 1ch 48000Hz   SUSPENDED\n\n$ pactl list sinks short\n55      alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo      PipeWire        s32le 2ch 48000Hz       SUSPENDED\n7960    bluez_output.04_9D_05_91_04_55.1        PipeWire        s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED\n\n$ cat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                      HDA Intel PCH at 0x612d188000 irq 220\n```\n\n\n## System Information\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nUbuntu 24.04 (Tuxedo OS)\nKDE Plasma 6.5.2, Wayland\n\n**CPU:**\n\n12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-12700H\n\n**GPU:**\n\nGraphics Processor 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU\nGraphics Processor 2: Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7dBnJm","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Are you able to help debug this issue?

The application launches successfully and appears in the system tray, but pressing the configured hotkey has no effect.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen pressing the configured global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+A), Handy should start listening and transcribing speech.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nPressing the configured hotkey does nothing. No visual feedback, no audio recording starts, and no logs indicate that the hotkey was detected.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install Handy .deb package on Ubuntu 24.04 (Wayland session)\n2. Launch Handy\n3. Configure global hotkey to Ctrl+Alt+A in Handy's settings\n4. Press Ctrl+Alt+A\n5. **Result**: Nothing happens\n\n## Investigation and Logs\n\n### Application Startup Logs\n\nWhen launching Handy with `RUST_LOG=debug handy`, the application starts successfully but shows no indication of attempting to register a global hotkey:\n\n```\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][tracing::span][INFO] perform;\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][tracing::span][INFO] authenticate;\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][zbus::connection::handshake::common][INFO] write_command; command=Auth(Some(External), Some([49, 48, 48, 48]))\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][zbus::connection::handshake::common][INFO] write_commands; commands=[Auth(Some(External), Some([49, 48, 48, 48]))] extra_bytes=None\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][tracing::span][INFO] read_command;\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][zbus::connection::handshake::common][INFO] read_commands; n_commands=1\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][tracing::span][INFO] send_secondary_commands;\n[...continues with D-Bus communication...]\n[2025-12-18][16:09:14][zbus::connection][INFO] monitor_name_lost; name=org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance\n```\n\n**Notable**: No logs mentioning \"hotkey\", \"keyboard\", \"keybind\", or \"global shortcut\" registration.\n\n### D-Bus Interface\n\nHandy exposes a D-Bus interface at `org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance`:\n\n```bash\n$ busctl --user tree org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance\n└─ /org\n  └─ /org/com_pais_handy\n    └─ /org/com_pais_handy/SingleInstance\n\n$ gdbus introspect --session --dest org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance --object-path /org/com_pais_handy/SingleInstance\nnode /org/com_pais_handy/SingleInstance {\n  interface org.SingleInstance.DBus {\n    methods:\n      ExecuteCallback(in  as argv,\n                      in  s cwd);\n    signals:\n    properties:\n  };\n  [... other standard D-Bus interfaces ...]\n};\n```\n\n### Attempted Workarounds (All Failed)\n\n#### 1. D-Bus method calls\n```bash\n$ gdbus call --session --dest org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance \\\n  --object-path /org/com_pais_handy/SingleInstance \\\n  --method org.SingleInstance.DBus.ExecuteCallback '[]' \"$(pwd)\"\n()  # Returns success but doesn't trigger recording\n\n$ gdbus call --session --dest org.com_pais_handy.SingleInstance \\\n  --object-path /org/com_pais_handy/SingleInstance \\\n  --method org.SingleInstance.DBus.ExecuteCallback '[\"--start\"]' \"$(pwd)\"\n()  # Returns success but doesn't trigger recording\n```\n\n#### 2. Forcing X11 session type\n```bash\n$ XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11 handy\n# Same behavior - hotkey still not detected\n```\n\n#### 3. Installing X11 development libraries\n```bash\n$ sudo apt install libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxkbcommon-x11-0\n# No change in behavior\n```\n\n#### 4. Checking MediaKeys service\n```bash\n$ systemctl --user status org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys\n● org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys.service - GNOME keyboard shortcuts service\n     Loaded: loaded\n     Active: active (running)\n# Service is running correctly\n```\n\n### Configuration Files\n\nNo configuration directory is created by Handy:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -la ~/.config/handy/\nls: cannot access '/home/pierre/.config/handy/': No such file or directory\n```\n\nThis suggests Handy may not be properly initializing its configuration system.\n\n## Additional Context\n\n### Microphone Verification\n\nThe system microphone works correctly:\n\n```bash\n$ arecord -d 5 test.wav && aplay test.wav\n# Successfully records and plays back audio\n```\n\n### Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts\n\nVerified that Ctrl+Alt+A is not used by any other system shortcut.\n\n### GNOME Shell Extensions\n\nAttempted installing `gnome-shell-extension-manager` and looking for AppIndicator support, but this did not resolve the issue.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nBased on the investigation, it appears that:\n\n1. **Handy does not attempt to register global hotkeys on Wayland**: The debug logs show no indication of hotkey registration attempts\n2. **No configuration directory is created**: Suggests initialization issues\n3. **D-Bus interface exists but has no recording trigger method**: The `ExecuteCallback` method exists but doesn't expose a way to start recording\n4. **Wayland global hotkey restrictions**: Wayland has stricter security policies around global hotkeys compared to X11\n\n## Workaround\n\nThe only current workaround is to switch to an X11 session:\n\n1. Log out\n2. On the login screen, click the gear icon (⚙️) \n3. Select \"Ubuntu on Xorg\"\n4. Log in\n5. Launch Handy - hotkeys work correctly\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nFor Wayland compatibility, Handy should:\n\n1. **Use the GNOME Shell D-Bus API** for registering global shortcuts:\n   - Interface: `org.gnome.Shell`\n   - Method: `GrabAccelerator` / `GrabAccelerators`\n\n2. **Or provide a Wayland-native input method** such as:\n   - Using portal APIs (xdg-desktop-portal)\n   - Implementing a GNOME Shell extension for global hotkey support\n\n3. **Add proper error logging** when hotkey registration fails, so users know what's happening\n\n4. **Document Wayland limitations** in the README if full support isn't feasible\n\n## References\n\n- GNOME Shell Keybindings: https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/meta13~13_api/meta.keybindings\n- Wayland Security Context: https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/\n- Similar issues in other applications: See projects like `libappindicator` migration to Wayland\n\n## System Packages Installed (for reference)\n\n```\nlibx11-dev\nlibxtst-dev\nlibxkbcommon-x11-0\nxdotool\nwmctrl\ngnome-shell-extension-manager\n```\n\n---\n\n**Would appreciate any guidance on implementing Wayland support or if there are plans to address this in a future release. Happy to test patches or beta versions.**","closedAt":"2025-12-18T17:02:35Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7a0daL","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Please read the **README**.

I'm on Parakeet V two which runs nearly instantaneously, so this was definitely a permanent hang and not just slowness.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** 0.6.8\n\n<!-- You can find this in the app settings or about section -->\n\n**Operating System:**\n\nsee attached\n\n<!-- e.g., macOS 14.1, Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04 -->\n\n**CPU:**\n\n<!-- e.g., Apple M2, Intel i7-12700K, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X -->\n\n**GPU:**\n\n<!-- e.g., Apple M2 GPU, NVIDIA RTX 4080, AMD RX 6800 XT, Intel UHD Graphics -->\n\n\n<img width=\"266\" height=\"551\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bfe0da3-1940-4916-8fe0-7a7eea9bf15f\" />\n<img width=\"978\" height=\"746\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699d062d-815d-43f7-82b4-5bc2d4fb01eb\" />\n<img width=\"990\" height=\"784\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52779ded-fdc8-4bee-9206-dc976f1c25e3\" />\n<img width=\"1016\" height=\"771\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616c4be4-f880-4c37-831f-0c82c2bb6872\" />\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"791\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c49efb-cb71-4418-95e6-b022714b75ff\" />\n<img width=\"262\" height=\"203\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e321537f-3f42-4ef7-9eaa-876706cd25a1\" />\n<img width=\"393\" height=\"241\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/658730e6-5ffc-48d0-8767-817e17722f15\" />\n<img width=\"55\" height=\"32\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f9a6fb-d348-453d-8597-948e05a6aa84\" />\n<img width=\"157\" height=\"49\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b633df-6dc5-485e-b4f0-032d41a5259e\" />","closedAt":"2026-01-10T03:38:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7aDwdh","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I would guess this is a possible duplicate or same bug fix that is needed for #406 \n\nCurious if the same bug shows up for you there too @joshribakoff \n\nI believe it was pressing and holding the shortcut when not in push to talk mode","createdAt":"2025-12-16T02:19:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/462#issuecomment-3658418017","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7aDzkR","author":{"login":"joshribakoff"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Feel free to close, but fyi I have push to talk ON when it happened.\n\nI do not believe it is the same bug, because if I hold down the hotkey combo while push to talk is off, it does what I would expect, which is continue recording even after I've let go until I tap it again.\n\nBecause it is a race condition, you never know if this is a signal or just me being unlucky and not replicating it.

Nice work you have done here.\n\nWe are experimenting with a fork of Handy for internal use at our company and ran into the same \"crash on first record press\" issue on some of our Windows machines. We've done analysis and found **two independent root causes** for silent crashes on Windows. Both may be relevant here. Claude summary below:\n\n## 1. ONNX Runtime `ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` crash on older CPUs\n\nThe pre-built ONNX Runtime 1.22.0 binaries shipped with `ort` v2.0.0-rc.10 likely contains CPU instructions that older processors can't execute. The OS raises `ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` (0xC000001D) and kills the process instantly — no error message, no log output.\n\n**What we found:**\n- The crash happens inside `commit_from_file()` when loading the Silero VAD model (or any ONNX model) — it's not model-specific, it's in ORT's initialization/kernel setup\n- We captured the exact native exception via a Windows SEH handler: `code=0xC000001D (ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION)`\n- Tested across 4 machines: 2x AMD Zen 3 (no AVX-512) → all crash with rc.10; 2x AMD Zen 4 (has AVX-512) → all pass\n- All 5 test variants (file/memory loading, default/explicit CPU EP, VAD/Parakeet model) crash at the **same instruction offset** in the binary\n\n**The fix (for our CPUs at least):** Upgrade `ort` from rc.10 to rc.11. The [rc.11 release notes](https://github.com/pykeio/ort/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.11) state: *\"x86_64 builds now target `x86-64-v3`\"* (AVX2, no AVX-512). rc.10 had no documented target level and likely included higher-level instructions. We confirmed rc.11 fixes the crash for `commit_from_file()` on both affected machines.\n\n**Note:** The Athlon II X3 450 from this issue would likelky still crash even with rc.11.** The Athlon II (K10, ~2010) only has SSE4a — it's x86-64-v1. Modern ONNX Runtime requires at least AVX. The rc.11 fix only helps v3-capable CPUs (like Zen 3) that lack v4 instructions.\n\n## 2. Windows microphone permission crash (silent `panic!` → process killed)\n\nWhen Windows denies microphone access (Settings > Privacy > Microphone), the app crashes instantly with no error. The root cause: `panic!()`/`.unwrap()`/`.expect()` calls inside the audio worker thread in `recorder.rs`. With `panic = \"abort\"` in the release profile, any panic kills the process silently. Easily testable on windows, when having this toggle off:\n\n<img width=\"1057\" height=\"173\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09bf3b3e-b82b-4704-b028-bb7da0f58b13\" />\n\nOn Windows, `device.supported_input_configs()` may succeed but `device.build_input_stream()` then returns \"Access is denied (0x80070005)\" — which triggers a panic and instant process death.\n\n**Fix:** Replace panics with proper `Result` error propagation. We moved `get_preferred_config()` before the thread spawn for early error detection and added a `sync_channel` so the worker thread reports stream-building success/failure before `open()` returns.\n\n---\n\nHope this analysis helps this project! Happy to provide more details on any of the above.\n\n**PS:**\nRegarding the mic permission issue, I attached a short .md file with more detailed describtion of the solution we went with. If you like that approach, you can use it to let AI built this approach. \n\n[mic_permission_crash_prevention.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25339480/mic_permission_crash_prevention.md)\n","createdAt":"2026-02-16T12:09:56Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/436#issuecomment-3908139697","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7o9OTX","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@LNReneF thanks for all the info.

My 2 cents are that it's a bit strange that the crash happens when the recording is supposed to start.

In this case Handy does not crash! However, it does not paste in the window with privileges, if the recording is stopped there. It can copy to clipboard though. Could it be that the privileged window somehow messes up the key-press?\n- Something remotely similar happens also with discord, which also has a push-to-talk option. No crash there, but if the focus is on a privileged window, the push-to-talk command is ignored (i.e. if it is not pressed when the focus shifts to the window, a later press is ignored; if it is already pressed when the focus shifts to the window, key release does not disable the recording).

For example, as a user of [Ditto](https://github.com/sabrogden/Ditto) (a clipboard manager), when you try to paste from Ditto into an elevated window, Ditto will prompt to run an elevated task, launching its own binary with elevated privileges, which then allows pasting into the elevated window. They call this \"UAC helper.\"\nYou can observe a similar behavior with an AutoHotkey script. \nAny workaround to bypass this behavior would create a potential security breach.\n\nSo, the best solution would probably be to fix the freezing bug first.  \nThen, for the scenario where \"Handy (not elevated)\" interacts with an \"elevated Notepad\" window, Handy could display a message (e.g., \"I’m not going to make it\" 😄) when an elevated target window is detected.\n\nEdit: \nAfter further consideration, here’s an ideal approach for handling an elevated window, assuming we don’t want to cancel the current transcription:\n\n1. Detect if the target window is elevated.\n2. The overlay alerts the user:  \n   `\"⚠ Handy cannot type in an elevated UAC window directly.\"`\n3. At the end of the transcription, the overlay displays a button to copy the content to the clipboard, with the message:  \n   `\"⚠ Handy cannot type in an elevated UAC window directly. Press this button to copy the current content to the clipboard, then manually paste it into your elevated window.\"`\n4. The user can then manually press Ctrl + V to paste the content.\n\nIt might not be the easiest to implement 😅, but this approach will guide the user through the process step by step.","createdAt":"2025-12-17T16:21:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/434#issuecomment-3666125182","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7avTfG","author":{"login":"giuliofoletto"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes sense, but the crash happens when the focus moves to an elevated window while recording, not at the end of the recording.

Configure Handy with Paste Method: Direct\n2. Use a global shortcut (via GNOME custom keybinding sending `SIGUSR2`) to start/stop recording\n3. Speak something\n4. The transcribed text is typed, but the first character is missing\n\n## Examples\n- Said: \"Hello, how are you?\" → Typed: \"ello, how are you?\"\n- Said: \"The quick brown fox\" → Typed: \"he quick brown fox\"\n\n## What we tried\n- Changing the keyboard shortcut (from `Ctrl+Space` to `²` key) → same issue\n- Adding a delay before sending `SIGUSR2` → no effect (the issue is after transcription, not before)\n- Installing `wtype` → doesn't work on GNOME (Mutter doesn't support the virtual keyboard protocol)\n- Installing `dotool` → works on GNOME, but Handy uses `enigo` internally, not dotool\n\n## Analysis\nLooking at the logs, Handy uses the `enigo` Rust library via X11/XTest:\n```\n[enigo::platform][DEBUG] x11 connection established\n[enigo::platform][DEBUG] fast text entry not available. Trying to enter individual letters now\n```\n\nThe first keypress seems to be \"eaten\", possibly due to timing issues with the key release from the trigger shortcut.\n\n## Possible solutions\n1. Add a small configurable delay (e.g., 50-100ms) before typing the first character\n2. Add support for `dotool` as an alternative backend (works on GNOME/Wayland via uinput)\n3.

When enigo needs to type a capital letter, it dynamically maps a keycode for the Shift modifier, and this mapping seems to cause the first character after the mapping to be \"eaten\".\n\n## What we tried\n\n1. **Adding a delay before typing** (50ms, 150ms, 300ms) → No effect\n2. **Adding dummy characters before the text** (spaces) → The dummy character was typed but the first real character was still eaten\n3. **Increasing `linux_delay` in enigo Settings** (50, 200) → No effect\n4. **Enabling `libei` backend** (`features = [\"libei_tokio\"]`) → libei connection is established at startup, but when `paste_via_direct_input` creates a new `Enigo` instance, it fails to reconnect to the libei socket and falls back to X11\n\n## Findings\n\n- The issue affects **every uppercase character**, not just the first one\n- Example: \"Hello everyone. This is a test\" → \"ello everyone his is a test\" (both \"H\" and \"T\" are eaten)\n- When forcing all text to lowercase with `text.to_lowercase()`, all characters are typed correctly\n\n## Potential fixes\n\n1. **Fix in enigo**: Investigate why the Shift keycode mapping causes character loss on X11\n2. **Keep libei connection alive**: Instead of creating a new `Enigo` instance for each paste, keep a persistent connection that was established at startup (when libei works)\n3. **Add a configurable delay specifically after Shift key mapping** in enigo","createdAt":"2025-12-10T00:55:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/429#issuecomment-3634902817","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7YqEKh","author":{"login":"hsablonniere"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> [@hsablonniere](https://github.com/hsablonniere) curious if you've tried the Shift+Ins paste method on Linux?

I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to work on it, but I can at least comment on it and give you my hunch.\n\nI noticed that issue last weekend too. I cannot explain it. I'm pretty sure it used to work with x11rb. The issue happens whenever the character is not present in the current layer of the keymap. On the English keymap for example there are only lowercase letters on the first level. You have to press shift to switch to a different level and then press the key to enter a capital letter.\n\nEnigo does not do that. We search the keymap for an unused keycode and then map the key symbol we want to enter to that keycode. The compositor is informed. Then we can tell the compositor the keycode was pressed. It looks up the symbol from the keymap. We also need that to be able to enter Unicode characters like the heart emoji. After we are done, the keycode we used gets unmapped so the keymap is just like before \n\nThe bug is somewhere in there. I have a guide on how to debug enigo and get logs in the repo. I've tried to find the problem, but was unsuccessful. The X11 messages all looked fine and the keymap got updated. It's very weird.\n\nIt would be awesome if you could investigate it.

The transcription is cut off and the result is lost.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Have Model A already downloaded and active (e.g., Whisper Small)\n2. Start downloading Model B (e.g., Whisper Medium) in the background\n3. While Model B is downloading, start a transcription with Model A\n4. Let Model B finish downloading during the active transcription\n5. **Result**: Transcription is interrupted/cut off as the app auto-switches to Model B\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe active transcription should complete normally. The newly downloaded model should either:\n- Not auto-switch at all (user manually selects when ready)\n- Wait until the current transcription completes before switching\n- At minimum, prompt the user before switching\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe model auto-switches immediately (after 500ms delay), regardless of whether a transcription is in progress, causing:\n- Active transcription to be interrupted\n- Potential loss of transcribed content\n- Poor user experience\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Location**: `src/components/model-selector/ModelSelector.tsx` lines 163-168 and 192-198\n\n```typescript\n// Listen for model download completion\nconst downloadCompleteUnlisten = listen<string>(\n  \"model-download-complete\",\n  (event) => {\n    const modelId = event.payload;\n    // ...\n\n    // Auto-select the newly downloaded model  <-- BUG\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      loadCurrentModel();\n      handleModelSelect(modelId);  // Switches immediately without checking state\n    }, 500);\n  },\n);\n```\n\nSame issue exists for `model-extraction-completed` event handler.\n\n**Why it causes interruption**:\n\n1. `handleModelSelect()` calls `commands.setActiveModel(modelId)`\n2. Backend `set_active_model` (`src-tauri/src/commands/models.rs:65-67`) calls `transcription_manager.load_model()`\n3. `load_model` (`src-tauri/src/managers/transcription.rs:251-254`) acquires the engine mutex and replaces the active engine\n4. If transcription is in progress, it gets interrupted when the engine changes\n\n## Possible Fixes\n\n**Option A - Remove auto-switch**:\nRemove the auto-select logic entirely. User manually selects the model when ready.\n\n**Option B - Check state before switching**:\nQuery backend for recording/transcription state before auto-switching. Only switch if idle.\n\n**Option C - Queue the switch**:\nAdd the model ID to a pending queue, switch after current transcription completes.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **App Version**: v0.6.4\n- **OS**: Windows (reported), likely affects all platforms (cross-platform code path)\n- **Affected Files**:\n  - `src/components/model-selector/ModelSelector.tsx`\n  - `src-tauri/src/commands/models.rs`\n  - `src-tauri/src/managers/transcription.rs`\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis is particularly problematic for users who:\n- Download multiple models to try them out\n- Have slow internet (long download times overlap with usage)\n- Use the app continuously while models download in background","closedAt":"2025-12-12T15:04:24Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7YBeIQ","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I think this is a corner case.

The overlay seems to hinder pasting on Linux (debian 13, with gnome and i3 on my end at least) and there is a simple solution: set \"Overlay position\" to `none` in the settings, in the \"Advanced\" submenu. Not knowing this make the app unusable, which is a pity, as the trick to overcome this is very simple and can even be compensated with the \"Audio feedback\".\n\nI stumbled on the solution in a [comment on a closed issue](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/138#issuecomment-3409195540) and I think the issue may also be related to the more general problem of how to paste in Linux (see #87). I have noticed Handy seems to not use fast input on my debian 13 with Xorg, which cause it to be less smooth and create also problems when using post-processing.","closedAt":"2025-11-29T23:34:17Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7VIbeh","author":{"login":"JulienWilhelm"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi, \n\nJust for record, \n\nI use the version 0.6.0 and i met the same problem with Linux Mint 22.1 Xia and xfce 4 with the .AppImage.\n\nI was unable to get the text produced from my speech. \nFixed by changing the overlay position to \"None\".\n\nAmazing job by the way @cjpais !","createdAt":"2025-11-25T13:50:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/379#issuecomment-3575756705","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Vs2vY","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@JulienWilhelm @nv2p I checked the code and the default for Linux should be 'None' for the overlay.

Maximizing the window (or un-maximizing it if already maximized) unblocks the title bar buttons.

Separate keyboard shortcuts**\n\nAdd two different hotkeys:\n\n* **Shortcut A → Raw transcription**\n* **Shortcut B → Transcription + post-processing**\n\nThis would allow instant switching based on context without toggling settings each time.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Multiple post-processing profiles (user-defined)**\n\nLet users create several post-processing profiles, for example:\n\n* “Email — professional tone”\n* “WhatsApp — casual”\n* “Bug report formatter”\n* “Summarize”\n* “Meeting notes”\n\n---\n\n### **3. Profile selection before / during / after recording**\n\nWhen starting a *post-processed* transcription, allow choosing which profile will be used.\n\nPossible UX:\n\n* A small dropdown next to the recording box, showing the currently selected post-processing profile\n* Default profile selected automatically\n* Optional: Changing the profile while recording updates the one used for the final output\n\nThis provides maximum convenience and avoids breaking the flow when switching contexts often.\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Why this is valuable\n\n* Enables **context-dependent use cases** without reconfiguring settings\n* Greatly improves efficiency for users who switch between email writing, messaging, and LLM-conversations\n* Makes the post-processing system much more powerful and user-friendly\n* Avoids accidental or unwanted rewrites when raw text is needed","closedAt":"2025-11-13T23:06:56Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7SZu1p","author":{"login":"yanniboi"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I've only just started using post processing, and I love the idea of multiple profiles.

The overlay seems to hinder pasting on Linux (debian 13, with gnome and i3 on my end at least), which is apparently not a new problem (see #138) and has a simple solution: set \"Overlay position\" to `none` in the settings, in the \"Advanced\" submenu. I think this would deserve to be on the main page as a known issue, so I will open an issue about it, also to make it more visible there. Not knowing this make the app unusable, which is a pity, as the trick to overcome this is very simple and can even be compensated with the \"Audio feedback\".\n2. The history problem, which is actually new. I retried the Appimage v0.5.5, 0.5.4 and the problem I had there was actually the overlay, not the history. Same with the success I had with the first transcription (only) when I restarted the app sometimes, I think.\n\nI can now say that it works well on Linux (with a bit more caveats and less smoothness, due to the input method, I think) and Windows 11, also the post-processing. It's amazing. The speed and accuracy with Parakeet (switching between French, German and English) is really impressive with my not so recent and strong laptop (Ryzen pro 5850u 32gb RAM, no GPU).

The logic here is: `has GPU with direct rendering support` AND `is not Wayland` AND `identifies as X11`.\n\n`/dev/dri` is present on virtually every modern Linux system and I suspect it doesn't really make sense in this context. If the latter ones are mutually exclusive the code / logic should actually be equivalent to:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n    {\n        if std::env::var(\"XDG_SESSION_TYPE\").unwrap_or_default() == \"x11\"\n        {\n            std::env::set_var(\"WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER\", \"1\");\n        }\n    }\n    handy_app_lib::run()\n}\n```\n\nBut the bug is not just present on X11, but also on Wayland. Neither is it limited to NVIDIA ([as sometimes hinted](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9394)) as I'm using the Intel iGPU with Wayland.\n\nFor now I would hence just disable the DMABUF renderer completely.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    #[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\n    {\n        // DMABUF renderer causes crashes on various GPU/display server configurations\n        // See: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9394\n        std::env::set_var(\"WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER\", \"1\");\n    }\n    handy_app_lib::run()\n}\n```","createdAt":"2026-02-11T11:08:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/308#issuecomment-3883743641","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7pLPXO","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I think this was closed by #789 by @suuuehgi ","createdAt":"2026-02-17T03:39:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/308#issuecomment-3912037838","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2025-11-06T14:50:54Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":308,"state":"CLOSED","title":"[BUG] Cannot get default EGL display: EGL_SUCCESS"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOBYra6Q","is_bot":false,"login":"mengate","name":"Frank Menzel"},"body":"## Bug Description\nI run handy on Debian 12 from the .deb package.

This feature will automatically optimize transcribed text using large language models (LLMs) with multiple optimization levels, ranging from basic filler word/verbal tic removal to comprehensive content summarization and restructuring. A similar implementation can be referenced in the project https://github.com/yan5xu/ququ, which has successfully deployed comparable text optimization capabilities in related scenarios.\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### 1. Multi-Level Optimization\nImplement a tiered optimization system with the following levels:\n- **Basic**: Removes filler words and”口头禅“ (\"um\", \"uh\", \"like\", etc.) while preserving original content and structure\n- **Standard**: Corrects grammatical errors, improves phrasing, and enhances readability\n- **Advanced**: Summarizes key points and restructures content for clarity and conciseness\n- **Custom**: Allows users to define optimization rules through prompts\n\n### 2. AI Model Integration\n- Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs as the primary interface\n- Special compatibility with major Chinese LLM providers (e.g., Alibaba Tongyi Qianwen, ByteDance Doubao) to ensure accessibility in mainland China\n- Configurable API endpoints, keys, and model selection in application settings\n\n### 3. Workflow Integration\n- Seamless post-processing after local speech-to-text conversion\n- One-click optimization with user-selectable intensity levels\n- Option to bypass AI optimization for sensitive content\n- Local caching of optimization preferences\n\nThis enhancement will significantly improve the usability of transcribed content while maintaining flexibility for different user needs and regional AI service availability.\n\nThank you for the awesome project and your hard work! 🙏\n","closedAt":"2025-11-03T14:21:17Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7PePfv","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"#222\n\nPlease look at existing issues or PRs before opening a new one.

Download the latest drivers directly from your GPU manufacturer:\n\nNVIDIA: https://www.nvidia.com/drivers\nAMD: https://www.amd.com/en/support\nIntel: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center\n\n2. Install/update the Vulkan Runtime\nIf updating drivers doesn't help, try installing the latest Vulkan Runtime from LunarG: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home\n\n3. Check if your GPU supports Vulkan 1.1+\nVery old GPUs may not support the required Vulkan version. You can check your current Vulkan support by:\n\nDownloading GPU-Z (https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)\nLooking at the Vulkan support information\n\n4. Reinstall the application\nAfter updating your drivers, try reinstalling Handy in case it needs to detect the new Vulkan capabilities.\n\n\n","createdAt":"2026-01-27T01:09:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/290#issuecomment-3802552151","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-11-02T14:01:22Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":290,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] Entry point vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2 could not be located in dynamic link library"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOC_zayw","is_bot":false,"login":"JCfly3000","name":""},"body":"Nice program :>\nI am using mac . is that possible to use  mlx version of whisper v3 turbo ? \nmodel link:https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo model \n\nThank you","closedAt":"2025-11-03T15:52:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Pf1aq","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Right now MLX is not planned to be supported, mainly because `transcribe-rs` does not have support.

But rather in the second position in the list, as if it copied the text and then replace the previous copied text at the top of the list again. \n\nIn practice, it won't affect anything in the way i use copy/past. \nLet's say I have a random text already copied (so at the top of the list on copyQ) : i use Handy for something completely unrelated and then I can past my previous text as if nothing happened (still at the top of CopyQ list). \nBut when i consult CopyQ list of copied text history, i end up with an endless of copied texts from all the Handy dictated texts that take place of my legit history of copy. Which slowdowns the copy/past workflow related to copyQ quite a bit when i need to go back in my history. I have basically two histories of Handy, one on Handy itself, and one on copyQ. \n\nDoes Handy secretly copy the dictated text to create the History and then somehow recopy the last copied entry so we don't notice it?

I asked the AI to help. So in the following I give you an excerpt of what it told me -- hence take it with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\\* All transcriptions of whisper models seem to be garbage but that is a separate issue.\n\n---\n\nTLDR (workaround):\n```\n./Handy_0.7.7_amd64.AppImage --appimage-extract\ncd squashfs-root && rm usr/lib/libvulkan.so.1 usr/lib/libwayland*\n./AppRun\n```\n\n***\n\n> ### Symptom\n> On Fedora (Optimus/iGPU mode), loading a Whisper model crashes the AppImage with a Vulkan C++ exception:\n> \n> ```\n> vk::Instance::enumeratePhysicalDevices: ErrorInitializationFailed\n> ```\n> \n> ### Code-level finding (why it aborts)\n> - Handy loads Whisper via `transcribe-rs` using `WhisperEngine::new()` followed by `engine.load_model(&model_path)` with no parameters to force CPU mode, disable Vulkan, or select a specific device.\n> - Handy depends on `transcribe-rs = 0.2.5` with the `whisper` feature enabled, so this Vulkan path is present in every shipped binary.\n> \n> ### Root cause — two bundled libraries that must not be bundled\n> \n> 1. **`usr/lib/libvulkan.so.1`** — The bundled Vulkan loader does not gracefully\n>    skip ICDs that return `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` during device\n>    enumeration (_Note: too old?_). This is triggered by the NVIDIA ICD when the dGPU is powered\n>    off in iGPU-only mode. The system loader (1.4.328) handles this correctly\n>    by skipping the failing ICD.\n> \n> 2. **`usr/lib/libwayland-*.so`** — The bundled Wayland libraries conflict with\n>    the running compositor. Vulkan ICDs and WSI layers load Wayland symbols at\n>    runtime; finding these stale bundled versions causes device enumeration to\n>    fail even when the Vulkan loader issue is addressed in isolation.\n> \n> Both are display-stack libraries that must match the running system and should\n> not be bundled in the AppImage.\n> \n> Note that environment variable overrides like `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"\"` have\n> no effect because the crash occurs before any device selection logic is reached —\n> device enumeration itself fails before ggml can filter the results.\n> \n> ***\n> \n> **Fix:** Exclude `libvulkan.so.1` and `libwayland-*.so*` from the AppImage\n> bundle via the linuxdeploy exclusion list configuration.\n> \n> **Secondary issue (upstream in `transcribe-rs`):** The bundled ggml/whisper.cpp\n> version does not wrap `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices()` in a `try/catch`, so any\n> Vulkan failure causes `std::terminate()` rather than a graceful CPU fallback.\n> This is already fixed in newer ggml versions. `transcribe-rs` should update its\n> bundled whisper.cpp.\n> \n> **Code-level resilience (long-term):** In `src-tauri/src/managers/transcription.rs`,\n> `WhisperEngine` is loaded with no model parameters (`engine.load_model(&model_path)`),\n> so it unconditionally defaults to GPU/Vulkan. `transcribe-rs` should expose a\n> `WhisperModelParams` struct (analogous to `ParakeetModelParams`) that includes a\n> `use_gpu: bool` field. This would allow Handy to either expose a \"CPU-only\" toggle\n> in settings, or automatically retry with `use_gpu: false` if the initial GPU load\n> fails — turning a hard crash into a graceful fallback.","createdAt":"2026-02-20T21:48:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/261#issuecomment-3937311886","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-29T10:59:26Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDON4t-Ns8AAAAB5VJfZQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":261,"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] Not able to use any of the Whisper models : makes Handy to crash"},{"author":{"id":"U_kgDOCSMdLA","is_bot":false,"login":"MyButtermilk","name":""},"body":"Is your feature request related to a problem?

The candidate’s voice comes from the browser tab audio, not my microphone, so Handy can’t capture it.\nHaving the ability to transcribe the output audio stream (system sound or selected device) would make Handy incredibly useful for recording and automatically transcribing calls, interviews, podcasts, or online videos.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nEnables full-quality transcriptions from both sides of online conversations.\n\nHelps interviewers, journalists, and researchers who need accurate logs of remote meetings.\n\nMakes Handy competitive with professional desktop STT tools that support “Stereo Mix” or “Virtual Audio Cable” input.\n\nEspecially useful for users with powerful GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4080) who can process local audio efficiently.\n\nPossible Implementation Ideas:\n\nAdd an option in Settings > Input Source to choose between Microphone, System Audio, or Virtual Device.\n\nIntegrate with Windows’ “Stereo Mix” input (if available).\n\nAllow users to select a specific output device to monitor and transcribe.\n\nOptionally, include a warning about privacy and user consent when recording system audio.\n\nExpected Outcome:\nHandy would become a more complete transcription tool capable of handling both live microphone dictation and playback-based transcription from browser tabs or media players.","closedAt":"2025-10-28T12:20:49Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7OAWFM","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Please move this to a discussion for a feature request.

Long story short, [ct2rs](https://github.com/jkawamoto/ctranslate2-rs) appears to satisfy what you asked for in issue #58. \n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a feature request to add CTranslate2-based Whisper transcription using the `ct2rs` Rust crate, which would provide significantly faster performance (10-40x real-time) compared to the current whisper.cpp implementation, especially on NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, Handy uses whisper.cpp via transcribe-rs, which provides good cross-platform compatibility with Vulkan support. However, on NVIDIA hardware transcription performance is suboptimal.\n\nWhile Parakeet offers excellent CPU performance, some users find Whisper models provide better transcription quality for their use cases.\n\n## Related Discussion\n\nThis builds on the discussion in #58, where @cjpais stated:\n\n> \"This has been discussed before, we will not use fasterwhisper at the moment. If there are nice versions of whisper with Ctranslate2 that have rust bindings I will consider it.\"\n\n**Good news: Such bindings exist!** 🎉\n\n## Proposed Solution: `ct2rs`\n\n[**ct2rs**](https://github.com/jkawamoto/ctranslate2-rs) is a production-ready Rust crate that provides native bindings to CTranslate2 (the same engine that powers Python's faster-whisper).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- ✅ **Rust-native** - No Python dependency required\n- ✅ **Whisper support** - Via `whisper` feature flag\n- ✅ **CUDA acceleration** - For NVIDIA GPUs\n- ✅ **ROCm support** - For AMD GPUs\n- ✅ **Same model format** - Compatible with faster-whisper models\n- ✅ **Actively maintained** - Latest version 0.9.10 (MIT licensed)\n- ✅ **Production-ready** - Used in several projects\n\n**Resources:**\n- Crate: https://crates.io/crates/ct2rs\n- GitHub: https://github.com/jkawamoto/ctranslate2-rs\n- Docs: https://docs.rs/ct2rs/latest/ct2rs/\n\n### Performance Benefits\n\nCTranslate2 provides significant performance improvements:\n- **4x faster** than original OpenAI Whisper implementation\n- **Better GPU utilization** with optimized CUDA/cuBLAS kernels\n- **Lower memory usage** with INT8/FP16 quantization support\n- **Optimized for inference** - Purpose-built for production transcription\n\nBenchmark comparison (from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/geekodour/8734b3bf22b8ede61fb5bfc92ce68fe3)):\n- whisper.cpp (CUDA): ~30-124 seconds for ~2min audio\n- CTranslate2 (CUDA float16): ~2.5-12.9 seconds for same audio\n\nReferences:\nIssue #58: https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/58\nCTranslate2 docs: https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/\nfaster-whisper (Python): https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper","closedAt":"2025-10-13T16:38:37Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7KjQaS","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Right now I don't have time to implement this.

This could apply to music in Spotify or a video playing in a browser, for example. It would help avoid having background sound picked up during the recording and just make the process smoother overall.\n\nExample flow:  \n- Press shortcut to start Handy recording → music or video pauses  \n- Recording ends → playback resumes\n\nSince Handy runs on multiple platforms, I imagine this could be handled differently depending on the OS. For example, maybe by sending a system media play/pause event or using platform-specific media APIs. I don’t know what’s best technically, but the idea would just be to have this simple automation that pauses and resumes playback around the recording session.\n\nAs a stretch idea, it would also be cool if Handy could enable the AirPods transparency mode when recording starts, so the user can hear their own voice better. I don’t think this is possible through public APIs, but just mentioning it in case it ever becomes doable.\n\nThanks again for all your work on Handy — it’s a really well-made and useful app.","closedAt":"2025-10-29T00:50:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7J3Ani","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thanks!

This could be handled rather easily with a simple autohotkey macro.\n\nEdit: I say this because the alternative gets into handy trying to figure out whether or not music is playing (on each of the various platforms) and reliably muting or pausing it, all while avoiding all the bugs for users who weren't listening to music. It's definitely doable, and if you plan to chase it might suggestion is that the keyboard media control play/pause might not be a bad way to do it. Alternatively, you might add an optional toggle to do something like mute all sound output while recording rather than trying to play/pause peoples music.","createdAt":"2025-10-16T16:41:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/192#issuecomment-3411737826","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7LadTw","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@therealpygon I agree with you, I'm going to close this issue for now.

Launch Handy application via AppImage\n2. Open application settings\n3. Attempt to change the AI model from one type to another (e.g., from Parakeet to Whisper or vice versa)\n4. Application immediately crashes with exit code 4\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe application should successfully switch between different AI models without crashing, allowing users to select their preferred model for transcription.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe application crashes during model initialization with exit code 4. The crash occurs after the model begins loading but before it completes initialization.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Model Configuration Conflict\n\nThe application's settings file shows:\n```\nselected_model: \"parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3\"\n```\n\nHowever, during startup, the application attempts to load:\n```\nwhisper_init_from_file_with_params_no_state: loading model from '/home/konrad/.local/share/com.pais.handy/models/ggml-small.bin'\n```\n\nThis indicates a mismatch between the configured model type (Parakeet - ONNX format) and the model being loaded (Whisper - GGML format).\n\n### Available Models\n\nIn the models directory (`~/.local/share/com.pais.handy/models/`):\n\n1. **Parakeet model** (working directory: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/`):\n   - `encoder-model.int8.onnx` (652 MB)\n   - `decoder_joint-model.int8.onnx` (18 MB)\n   - `nemo128.onnx` (139 KB)\n   - `vocab.txt` (93 KB)\n   - `config.json`\n\n2. **Whisper model**:\n   - `ggml-small.bin` (468 MB)\n\n### GPU/Vulkan Configuration\n\nThe application successfully detects Vulkan:\n```\nggml_vulkan: Found 1 Vulkan devices:\nVulkan0: AMD Radeon Graphics (RADV RENOIR) (radv) | uma: 1 | fp16: 1 | warp size: 64\nwhisper_init_with_params_no_state: use gpu = 1\nwhisper_init_with_params_no_state: backends = 2\n```\n\n## Additional Errors/Warnings\n\n### Audio System Issues (Non-Critical)\n\nThe application generates numerous ALSA OSS warnings:\n```\nALSA lib pcm_oss.c:397:(_snd_pcm_oss_open) Cannot open device /dev/dsp\n```\n\nThese appear to be non-critical as they occur due to the absence of legacy OSS audio drivers on modern Linux systems using PipeWire/PulseAudio.\n\n### GVFS Module Loading Failures (Non-Critical)\n\n```\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gvfs/libgvfscommon.so: undefined symbol: g_task_set_static_name\nFailed to load module: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so\n```\n\nThese warnings appear to be related to the AppImage environment and don't directly cause the crash.\n\n### AppImage Launcher Warning (Non-Critical)\n\n```\nFailed to enable unit: Unit file /etc/xdg/systemd/user/appimagelauncherd.service is masked.\nFailed to start appimagelauncherd.service: Unit appimagelauncherd.service is

using environment variables:\n```bash\nALSA_CARD=0 WHISPER_NO_GPU=1 /path/to/Handy.AppImage\nALSA_CARD=0 GGML_VULKAN=0 GGML_CUDA=0 /path/to/Handy.AppImage\n```\n\nHowever, the application still attempts to use GPU (`use gpu = 1`) and crashes with the same exit code 4.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe issue appears to be caused by:\n\n1. **Model type mismatch**: The application configuration specifies a Parakeet model, but the code attempts to load a Whisper model\n2. **Lack of error handling**: The application should gracefully handle model switching failures or incompatibilities\n3. **Missing validation**: No validation appears to occur to ensure the correct model loader is used for the model type\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. Add proper error handling during model switching to prevent crashes\n2. Implement validation to ensure the correct model loader (Parakeet vs Whisper) is used based on the model file format\n3. Provide user feedback if a model fails to load instead of crashing silently\n4. Consider adding a model type detection mechanism based on file format\n5. Ensure settings are properly synchronized with the actual model being loaded\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- The application works fine when not attempting to change models\n- Both model types exist in the models directory simultaneously\n- The crash is reproducible 100% of the time when changing models\n- Audio configuration issues (OSS/ALSA warnings) do not appear to be the cause of the crash\n","closedAt":"2025-10-14T14:11:35Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7JlB4J","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"This is a known issue with some systems and whisper.","createdAt":"2025-10-08T14:49:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/184#issuecomment-3381927433","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7Kn2QE","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@kkarpieszuk could you check if 0.5.3 resolves this for you","createdAt":"2025-10-14T00:00:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/184#issuecomment-3399443460","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7KsGoS","author":{"login":"kkarpieszuk"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Wow, it works, thank you very much.  this message has been recorded with handy.

Personally, I find both quite useful in different circumstances.\n2. It would be really great if there were some simple command line options. For example, to start dictation either under push to talk mode or under the other mode (a different command line option for each). This way, it would be possible to assign shortcuts in my window manager, which would be more flexible than just the handy shortcut. For example, having a single modifier key to open the dictation.\n\nMany thanks again. I have been looking for something like this for ages.

This results in the error:\n\n```\nALSA lib pcm_oss.c:397:(_snd_pcm_oss_open) Cannot open device /dev/dsp\n```\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n1. CPAL auto-detects available audio hosts on system startup\n2. OSS compatibility layers may be present on the system (even if not actively used)\n3. CPAL's host selection algorithm chooses OSS over ALSA in some configurations\n4. OSS tries to access `/dev/dsp` which either doesn't exist or isn't properly configured\n5. This causes all audio recording/playback functionality to fail\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install Handy on a Linux system with both ALSA and OSS compatibility present\n2. Launch the application\n3. Attempt to use any audio recording functionality\n4. Observe the error messages in console output\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nCPAL should prioritize ALSA as the default audio backend on modern Linux systems, or provide better fallback mechanisms when the selected backend fails to initialize.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nCPAL selects OSS backend, attempts to open `/dev/dsp`, fails with \"Cannot open device\" error, and audio functionality becomes unavailable.\n\n## System Information\n\n**App Version:** 0.5.0\n\n**Operating System:** EndeavourOS (Arch Linux) with kernel 6.5.6-arch2-1-g14\n\n**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS with Radeon Graphics\n\n**GPU:** \n- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q\n- AMD Radeon Vega Series (integrated)\n\n**Audio System:**\n- ALSA version: System default\n- CPAL version: 0.16.0\n- OSS compatibility: Present but not actively used\n\n## Workaround (Linux only)\n\nThe issue can be resolved by explicitly forcing CPAL to use the ALSA backend instead of relying on auto-detection:\n\n```rust\n// Replace:\nlet host = cpal::default_host();\n\n// With:\nlet host = cpal::host_from_id(cpal::HostId::Alsa)\n    .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!(\"Failed to create ALSA host: {}\", e))?;\n```\n\nThis change needs to be applied in multiple files:\n- `src-tauri/src/audio_toolkit/audio/recorder.rs:65`\n- `src-tauri/src/audio_toolkit/audio/device.rs:11,33`\n- `src-tauri/src/audio_feedback.rs:70`\n\n## Suggested Fix (Linux only)\n\n1. **For Handy**: Implement explicit ALSA backend selection on Linux instead of relying on CPAL's auto-detection\n2. **For CPAL**: Improve host selection algorithm to prefer ALSA over OSS on modern Linux systems\n3. **For Handy**: Add better error handling and fallback mechanisms when audio initialization fails\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis issue affects Linux users who have OSS compatibility layers installed (common on Arch-based distributions) but primarily use ALSA. The problem is particularly confusing because:\n\n- ALSA is working fine system-wide\n- Other audio applications work correctly\n- The error message points to OSS (`/dev/dsp`) rather than indicating a backend selection issue\n- The actual cause (CPAL backend selection) is not immediately obvious from the error\n\n## Error Logs\n\n```\nALSA lib pcm_oss.c:397:(_snd_pcm_oss_open) Cannot open device /dev/dsp\n```\n\nThis error indicates that CPAL selected the OSS backend and is trying to access the legacy OSS device file `/dev/dsp`.","closedAt":"2025-10-09T00:47:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7HWyJ5","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"If you can, could you submit a PR to fix?

This is a sounding promise, but in reality the ecosystem is fragmented. Because:\n\n- People often disagree with others’ design and come out with their own solution (especially GNOME).\n- Niche compositors don’t have the manpower to implement everything.\n- Protocol iterates and different implementation supports different versions of the protocol.\n- Wayland is indeed designed with security in mind. Many features are sacrificed for security design at the beginning. Due to the lack of decent authentication mechanism, people don’t bother to implement them.\n- …\n\nEvery protocol we mentioned are not universally supported even if you ignore the niche ones. Implementation-specific (and even upstream contribution) code is a must. Developing them in a separate project might let us move faster, especially considering that Linux users have more technical background on average. With good library design we can hopefully later merge it back to Handy.\n\nPractically speaking, to register global shortcut, supporting `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.GlobalShortcuts` portal and `hyprland-global-shortcuts-v1` protocol should work for GNOME, KDE and Hyprland users.\n\nA possibly more universal workaround is:\n\n- Provide a CLI option/binary, which talks to the \"main\" program through some IPC\n- User manually bind hotkey to a shell command that calls Handy. I think all desktop/compositors support this.\n- User press hotkey and Handy starts recording.\n- User press hotkey again and Handy stops recording and perform transcription.\n\nPush-to-talk not so possible I guess, because there is no universal way to detect press and release event separately.\n\nAfter that, Handy pipes transcription result to `wl-copy`. Users paste it manually.\n\nIf we want to put the result on screen automatically, `enigo` does have limited support. However, according to my test today: for its wayland backend, it either calls [`virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1`](https://wayland.app/protocols/virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1) or [`input-method-unstable-v2`](https://wayland.app/protocols/input-method-unstable-v2). Both are not universally supported. Besides, virtual keyboard cannot input Unicode, and input method backend implementation will conflict with real input method engine (ibus/fcitx5, CJK people will cry). Not sure it's protocol limitation or implementation bug. For its libei backend, it requires support from xdg-desktop-portal. I am unsure about this part, it seems to be some GNOME thing. Doesn't work on my mahchine anyways.\n\nThat's all I've learned from my little experiments today.\n\nIf we want to support more advanced features, say, realtime transcription. We will most likely have to fight with input method protocols...","createdAt":"2025-10-16T16:57:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/140#issuecomment-3411789273","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7LXthL","author":{"login":"tmikaeld"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I’ve found the same things and agree with the universally suggested approach, triggering by command and then piping to wl-copy, then the text is in clipboard.","createdAt":"2025-10-16T17:31:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/140#issuecomment-3411990603","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7LaOv_","author":{"login":"noelmiller"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@merrkry It looks like this [project](https://github.com/sevos/waystt) does exactly what you are proposing with a CLI tool.

A bit like you'd talk to Alexa or Google Home but for speech-to-text.\n\n- Easier, use a third party app to trigger the hotkey itself (in my case i use Voice Macro, which listens to the mic all the time, dunno if there is better) so Handy opens listening with the trigger word associated to the hotkey. \nBut it would mean to have a feature a bit similar to \"custom words\" but working the other way around : meaning a set of words that Handy would purposely ignore when pronounced. \nExample : \"Start listening\" on Voice Macro -> triggers Ctrl +space, Handy listens, \"Stop listening\" on Voice macro -> Triggers Ctrl + Space again, Handy stops listening and transcribe. \nIn this example, The first \"Start listening\" is not really relevant since Handy shouldn't pick it up yet, but the second \"Stop listening\" will be injected in the speech to text after each transcription. So a feature to ignore words or/and expression we want would prove to be useful without having to implement anything else on your end.\n\nIn both cases, that would also require a second \"small\" request i guess. Which is being able to link \"start listening\" and \"stop listening\" to two different hotkeys. In the second case, from Handy's end, it would be exactly the same command but it would make the voice triggering from third party apps a bit easier. Like in video games when a same action can be bound to two completely different buttons/shortkeys regardless of which ones we use. \n\nMy request is just a rough idea i came up with. If anyone has a better workaround solution for it, i'm very willing to try it out. The ultimate goal is simply to trigger speech-to-text without using \"manual\" shortkeys (and without Handy intercepting the trigger word in its transcription either). Also, all my ideas would exclude using \"Push to talk\", since i don't see this mode being suitable for my situation. \n\nThank you.

This would give the system another chance to generate a more accurate transcript without requiring the user to re-record the message.\n\nProposed solution:\n\t•\tAdd a “Reprocess transcription” button next to each recording in the History view.\n\t•\tOn click, the audio file is resubmitted to the transcription backend.\n\t•\tReplace or append the new transcript, possibly showing versions if multiple attempts exist.\n\nBenefits:\n\t•\tImproves user confidence in transcription results.\n\t•\tSaves time compared to re-recording audio.\n\t•\tProvides flexibility for cases where transcription accuracy fails on the first pass.\n\nExample:\n\t•\tA 17-second voice note was only transcribed as “Petite question de travail.”\n\t•\tA reprocess option could potentially return a more complete transcript closer to the actual spoken audio.\n","closedAt":"2025-12-16T09:56:08Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7FrLBz","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Yeah I would like this as well.

It's definitely possible to compile whisper.cpp without AVX2, my main concern is performance on other systems that do have it. I'm certainly open to a PR which disables it and I can at least validate the performance hit.\n\nSee for disabling AVX2... Might need to fork whisper-rs and modify `build.rs` in sys as far as I can tell: https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/discussions/1793\n\nThis is happening when trying to set up the Vulkan device. I'm not really sure why the call to GGML requires AVX2 there, maybe setting up for efficient transfer of data to Vulkan? \n\nAnd right now, I'm a solo developer, and I believe Ollama uses a script to figure out exactly how to build for your system, and Handy as an application distribution, I'm not ready to go on that endeavor yet. Where at least fallback to CPU is possible even if not preferable. I'm fairly new to all this cross-platform stuff, especially acceleration on such a wide variety of systems, and I didn't quite realize how much it was going to be to support across the board. I'm doing my best to make everything work smoothly as much as possible for everyone, but I really do need additional help to make it super robust. \n\nI only have a limited set of computers to test on, and testing itself takes a lot of time. Likely, I will be adding system requirements so at least there's some idea of if it will run well on your system or not. I do need the reports to know what systems it runs well on and what systems it does not run well on so this is very helpful regardless, though I'm bummed it's not working for you and I am trying to figure out the best and most reasonable solutions that work for a variety of hardware. And whisper.cpp with vulkan is causing more headaches than I expected. \n\nThis is partially why I'm interested in Parakeet even if CPU only for a little bit while I can start building up the GPU support via CUDA/RocM etc and validating it as well as making sure it builds properly and can be easily distributed. I've tested a handful of my computers and Parakeet runs quite well CPU only, but on an older CPU it still may only run in real time or even a little slower. I tested it on an Intel N3450 yesterday and it runs just slower than real time on a 50 second clip, taking ~55 seconds. I don't find that to be acceptable performance, so I was thinking at least moonshine may be able to be used on much older systems even if the transcription performance is not ideal.\n\nRegardless obviously your system should be GPU accelerated, and maybe there's a way to get CUDA/RocM bindings in as well, I just left them out for the sake of simplicity initially and that Vulkan worked well enough on all the systems I tested and theoretically had wide compatibility ","createdAt":"2025-08-20T16:25:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/91#issuecomment-3207091408","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns7DFNiz","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Not sure if you can try @shockme, but maybe 0.5.0 with Parakeet will work fine for you? \n\nOn my i5 Skylake CPU, it runs five times faster than real time.

I did recently remove some BLAS support which may make the CPU inference run slower than before. Perhaps I can add it back, but I do need to test it. Let me see if I can find a machine with a lower power CPU and no GPU to see how it does. In addition I'll go through and see if there's any other optimizations on CPU that can be made where possible. \n\nRight now I am not planning to add support for remote Whisper API as the app is meant for local use only. And due to this there are effectively system requirements. \n\nI've had another request for API support in the past and I will think about how best to solve the issue of hardware. For now though the application will remain local only. I especially would like to not rely on specific API providers nor ones that make you pay. \n\nPerhaps there is a way that people who are running Handy can spare some of their idle compute to do transcriptions for others that don't have the hardware to do so. This is obviously a much more complex thing to do and would have to be carefully crafted and opt-in.  I'm not confident this is the way forward but something I'm pondering.\n\nAnother thought is maybe a computer donation program or something. Surely there are many people with older computers that are still quite powerful that are sitting around for one reason or another. Perhaps it's possible to get them moving and be an upgrade for someone else.

Handy doesn't have to do everything for everyone. At some point I have to draw a line in the sand for what the boundaries of the app are. Every issue and PR that comes up is me figuring out what they are. For now it is designed to be local-only. Not just local-first. Why? I guess that's just what I want from the app. I don't have much more explanation than that. I like the constraint and wish it to continue. I'm not on a holy war against API's or whatever, I use many of them and even host a whisper API myself (https://geppetto.app), but I like that the project doesn't use them. I think the market is saturated with projects that do, and I just want something different.\n\nI partially like the constraint because it means I can't hide from the fact that not every machine can run it well. And I want to feel and know that. I want to push and understand the models and the acceleration to make it so that it can. There is room for improvement. I would love to train a model even that runs well on the CPU. I really believe that this technology should be ubiquitous, and I want to understand the edges of what that means. Contemplate them.\n\nAnyone is free to fork it and make it work and I will gladly support that fork and direct people to it and if there is enough support maybe merge it if the UX is good. There are plenty of alternatives that already support API's. One example is: https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering\n\nI also suspect BLAS is not enough either. And I do agree with you as well, but it's out of the scope for me at the moment of what I want to support with Handy.\n\nAnd also with all of this said, I am still open to the idea especially if the community as a whole would like it. I do need more support and feedback and arguments to be satisfied in supporting it. I'm happy for this issue to be a discussion for adding API support, and the best way to do so for user experience while keeping the app FOSS. \n\nI do think people with lower end hardware should have access to transcription as well and it will be something I'll be thinking about more regardless.\n\nI may be happy to add a sponsored endpoint (and maybe geppetto will be this) or something, if it means that the user experience can just be flipping a switch. I don't really want someone to put an API key in. I don't think this technology should be limited to just people with the requisite hardware, nor do I think people should have to pay for it.\n\nI only write this much because I do care, and care a lot. I don't know the best way forward. I'm playing with ideas and possibilities and stumbling through them. And at the same time I want to make a wonderful user experience. I want to understand more about the space, and the limitations.","createdAt":"2025-08-15T03:26:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":5}}],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/77#issuecomment-3190500794","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns6-S175","author":{"login":"burntcouscous"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your very thoughtful reply.

Only restarting the app allows me to reset it properly.\n\nI can change now the hotkey as long as I dont use the win/command key!\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70e638b4-062d-4084-b189-1078de06f969","createdAt":"2025-08-02T15:28:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/63#issuecomment-3146568584","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns67jTL_","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Awesome thank you for the detailed video, this is super helpful.

It has become the de-facto, state-of-the-art engine for any serious application, and it's the core of major tools.\nOn top of the speed, it also has built-in VAD for cleaner transcripts and a much simpler installation, making it more robust for production use\n\nHere is the project page \nhttps://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper\n\nhere is nerdy chart that i made \n<img width=\"953\" height=\"388\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc5ed03-e65a-4eb2-9382-4c988946297b\" />\n\n---\n\n## Quick Answers for Likely Questions\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Is the accuracy the same?</strong></summary>\n  <blockquote>\n    Yes. The library's README states it delivers the same accuracy. It's just a faster engine for the same models.\n  </blockquote>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>How hard is it to switch?</strong></summary>\n  <blockquote>\n    It looks like a near drop-in replacement. The API is very similar to openai/whisper.\n  </blockquote>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>What's the catch?</strong></summary>\n  <blockquote>\n    It uses a different backend (CTranslate2), which is a new dependency. But the performance boost is the major payoff.\n  </blockquote>\n</details>\n\n---\n## FUTO - state of the art models for edge devices \n### Why This Matters\n\nMost open-source Whisper implementations suffer from high latency. For example, the Whisper small model can take **10–15 seconds** to process 7–15 seconds of audio on a modern Core i5 10th gen CPU (**Linux Debian**). This poor user experience drives many users to use cloud APIs, which often return results in under 5 seconds, even for 20–30 second audio clips, ***1.38$ per month avg for moderate usage (privacy nightmare)***.\n\nFUTO solves this problem. Their models run entirely offline, deliver much lower latency, and maintain strong accuracy allowing even smallest models to compete with old giants. This allows open-source tools to finally match (or exceed, ***in short transcriptions***) the responsiveness of proprietary APIs.\n\n\n\n<img width=\"852\" height=\"591\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1968410d-e525-4a61-8beb-ee8f0dcdfd77\" />\n\n### ACFT (Audio Context Fine-Tuning) \nThis technique make the smaller models surprisingly good and accurate (**ive used them on phone extensively for developer related technical discussions**)\n\n- **Solves Whisper’s core 30-second audio context limitation that causes errors and inefficiency.**\n- **Enables accurate transcription of short audio clips without retraining from scratch.**\n- **Converts Whisper from impractical for real-time use to instant and dependable for voice input, even on mobile devices.**\n\n<img width=\"714\" height=\"467\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/138ccab5-8d82-466d-82b0-302162b439dd\" />\n\n### Potential use cases of this model \nMany Linux and Windows users are on lower-power devices—older CPUs, limited VRAM (unlike **_M series macs_**) and often no dedicated GPU. Running default Whisper models at acceptable speeds is nearly impossible for them. FUTO’s optimized models can run fast even on mobile phones, which means they will also perform exceptionally well on these less privileged devices.This makes real-time transcription more accessible to everyone, regardless of the power of their machine.\n\n\n\nWould you kindly consider evaluating and possibly integrating some of these state-of-the-art models? I believe this could make a meaningful difference for many users.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration and excellent work on this repo \n\nWarm regards,\nA Grateful User","closedAt":"2025-07-31T18:51:14Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns67OAji","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"This has been discussed before, we will not use fasterwhisper at the moment.

Claude code in particular can be really amazing. I mostly am using Zed agent mode personally but both are wonderful. Most of this code base has been written using Claude or other AI models, and a lot of other contributors I believe have been using Claude as well based on the code that's been written. It reminds me a lot of Claude's style. So I'd recommend these tools if you ever want to give it a shot and if you need some kind of tutorial or something I can potentially put something together to kind of show how to work on this code base or any open source code base with these tools.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I basically discussed with the AI models for this change and kind of read the code that it was going to come up with before actually putting into the project. And most of it seemed pretty reasonable to me and seems like it could implement it more or less itself. And that makes it really easy for this issue to actually be implemented effectively. You basically did all of the work just by specifying what you wanted and saying it in enough detail where I could give it to the model.\n\nHere is the exact prompt I used. Dictated using Handy\n\n> Take a look at this code base and can you think about how it could be refactored in such a way where there's an additional setting like a checkbox or toggle that basically would enable the freeing up of VRAM or memory in the case of like some inactivity of transcription. Maybe it's five minutes, maybe it's 10 minutes. Maybe this is a configurable parameter instead of it being a checkbox, maybe it's a drop down where it gives you a few options, maybe once five minutes, one, maybe once 15 and an hour, or something like that just so the program can automatically free up resources if it's not actively being used. So other programs could use those resources.","createdAt":"2025-08-15T17:39:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/57#issuecomment-3192280059","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns6-R8B8","author":{"login":"kleju13"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I might have phrased that a bit poorly.

Parakeet v3 offers substantial\n  performance advantages (50-1000x faster inference) but comes with important trade-offs in language support and implementation complexity.\n\n  Current Architecture Analysis\n\n  Whisper Integration (Current State)\n\n  The Handy app currently uses a well-integrated Whisper implementation:\n\n  Core Components:\n  - Transcription Manager (src-tauri/src/managers/transcription.rs): Manages WhisperContext and WhisperState with model loading and\n  transcription logic\n  - Model Manager (src-tauri/src/managers/model.rs): Handles model downloads, caching, and selection for Small/Medium/Turbo/Large Whisper\n  variants\n  - Audio Pipeline: AudioRecorder → VAD (Silero) → Whisper → Text output at 16kHz sample rate\n  - Platform Optimization: Metal (macOS), Vulkan (Windows/Linux) via whisper-rs features\n\n  Key Features Currently Supported:\n  - Multi-language transcription with automatic detection\n  - Translation to English capability\n  - Model size options (244MB to 1.6GB)\n  - Resumable downloads with progress tracking\n  - Hardware acceleration on all platforms\n\n  Parakeet v3 Technical Assessment\n\n  Performance Advantages\n\n  - Speed: RTFx of 3,380 vs Whisper's 2-5, processes 60 minutes of audio in 1 second\n  - Accuracy: 6.05% WER on HF Open ASR Leaderboard (ranked #1)\n  - Efficiency: 600M parameters vs Whisper Large's 1.55B (60% reduction)\n  - Audio Length: Supports up to 24 minutes in single pass vs Whisper's shorter segments\n\n  Technical Capabilities\n\n  - Languages: 25 European languages (expansion from v2's English-only)\n  - Features: Native punctuation/capitalization, precise word-level timestamps\n  - Architecture: FastConformer encoder + Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) decoder\n  - Hardware: Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, requires minimum 2GB RAM\n\n  Limitations vs Whisper\n\n  - Language Coverage: 25 European languages vs Whisper's 99+ languages\n  - Multilingual Tasks: Less versatile than Whisper's multi-task capabilities\n  - Ecosystem Maturity: Newer model with less mature tooling ecosystem\n\n  Migration Challenges & Requirements\n\n  1. Rust Integration Challenges\n\n  Current Status:\n  - ONNX Runtime Rust bindings available via ort crate (actively maintained)\n  - Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly\n  - Multiple execution providers (CPU, CUDA, TensorRT, CoreML, etc.)\n\n  Implementation Gaps:\n  - No direct parakeet-rs equivalent to whisper-rs\n  - Requires ONNX export from NeMo toolkit\n  - More complex preprocessing/postprocessing pipeline\n  - Manual audio format handling (vs whisper-rs's built-in support)\n\n  2. Model Format Migration\n\n  Current: Binary .bin files (244MB-1.6GB) downloaded from blob.handy.computer\n  Target: ONNX format models requiring NeMo export pipeline\n\n  Required Changes:\n  - Update model download URLs to ONNX-exported Parakeet models\n  - Modify model management to handle ONNX format validation\n  - Implement ONNX model loading in TranscriptionManager\n  - Update model size calculations and storage requirements\n\n  3. API Compatibility Issues\n\n  whisper-rs API (current):\n  let context = WhisperContext::new_with_params(path, params)?;\n  let state = context.create_state()?;\n  state.full(params, &audio)?;\n\n  ONNX Runtime API (target):\n  let session = SessionBuilder::new()?.with_model_from_file(path)?;\n  let inputs = inputs![\"audio\" => audio_tensor]?;\n  let outputs = session.run(inputs)?;\n\n  Impact: Complete rewrite of transcription logic, parameter handling, and result processing.\n\n  4. Platform Acceleration Compatibility\n\n  Current: Direct Metal/Vulkan support via whisper-rs\n  Target: ONNX Runtime execution providers\n\n  Platform Support:\n  - macOS: CoreML provider (mature) + Metal (experimental)\n  - Windows: DirectML, CUDA, TensorRT providers\n  - Linux: CUDA, TensorRT, OpenVINO providers\n\n  Risk: Potential performance regression on Apple Silicon due to less mature Metal support in ONNX Runtime.\n\n  5. Feature Parity Concerns\n\n  Translation Capability:\n  - Whisper: Built-in translation to English\n  - Parakeet v3: No native translation (would require separate model)\n\n  Language Detection:\n  - Whisper: Automatic language detection from 99+ languages\n  - Parakeet v3: Automatic detection from 25 European languages only\n\n  Audio Preprocessing:\n  - Whisper: Handled internally by whisper-rs\n  - Parakeet v3: Requires manual implementation of audio preprocessing pipeline\n\n  Risk Assessment\n\n  High Risks\n\n  - Translation Loss: No built-in English translation capability\n  - Language Regression: Significant reduction from 99+ to 25 languages\n  - Apple Silicon Performance: Potential regression due to ONNX Runtime Metal limitations\n  - Ecosystem Maturity: Less mature tooling and community support\n\n  Medium Risks\n\n  - Development Complexity: Significantly more complex implementation\n  - Model Distribution: Need to set up ONNX export and hosting pipeline\n  - Memory Usage: Potential increase due to ONNX Runtime overhead\n\n  Low Risks\n\n  - Performance Gains: Well-documented speed improvements likely achievable\n  - Accuracy Improvements: Benchmarked accuracy gains expected\n  - Platform Support: ONNX Runtime has good cross-platform support\n\n  Recommendations\n\n  Option 1: Full Migration (Recommended for Performance-Critical Use Cases)\n\n  Best for: Users prioritizing speed and accuracy for European languages\n  Timeline: 12-16 weeks\n  Effort: High\n  Benefits: 50-1000x speed improvement, better accuracy, smaller model size\n\n  Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Maximum Compatibility)\n\n  Implementation: Parakeet v3 for European languages, Whisper fallback for others\n  Timeline: 16-20 weeksEffort: Very High\n  Benefits: Best performance for supported languages while maintaining full language coverage\n\n  Option 3: Gradual Migration (Recommended for Risk Mitigation)\n\n  Implementation: Add Parakeet v3 as optional engine, default to Whisper\n  Timeline: 8-12 weeks\n  Effort: Medium-High\n  Benefits: User choice, gradual validation, easy rollback\n\n  Technical Implementation Plan\n\n  Recommended Architecture Changes\n\n  1. Abstract Transcription Interface: Create trait-based system supporting both engines\n  2. Engine Selection Logic: Automatic engine selection based on detected language\n  3. Model Management Updates: Support both Whisper .bin and ONNX formats\n  4. Configuration System: User preference for engine selection and fallback behavior\n\n  Required Dependencies\n\n  [dependencies]\n  ort = \"1.16\"                    # ONNX Runtime bindings\n  tokenizers = \"0.14\"             # For SentencePiece tokenization\n  ndarray = \"0.15\"               # Tensor operations\n  # Keep existing whisper-rs for fallback\n  whisper-rs = { version = \"0.13.2\", optional = true }\n\n  Conclusion\n\n  Migration to Parakeet v3 is technically feasible and would provide significant performance benefits for the target use case of European\n  language transcription. However, it represents a major architectural change with substantial trade-offs in language coverage and feature\n  completeness.\n\n  Recommended Approach: Implement a hybrid solution where Parakeet v3 handles European languages for maximum performance, while maintaining\n  Whisper as a fallback for comprehensive language support and translation capabilities. This provides the best of both worlds while managing\n  implementation risks.\n\n  The 50-1000x performance improvement for supported languages makes this migration compelling for users focused on European languages, but\n  the reduced language coverage means it shouldn't completely replace Whisper for a global user base.","createdAt":"2025-08-21T18:06:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues/18#issuecomment-3211596575","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDON4t-Ns6_cp_8","author":{"login":"cjpais"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I've got an architecture and plan in mind :) we are going to support both for sure.

From some rough measurements I took, it can take about 100ms on MacOS to start the microphone. This is a latency penalty I am slightly concerned about, especially for users thinking they can just immediately start speaking after pressing a keyboard shortcut. \n\nThe tradeoff of this is that on MacOS you see the microphone always active anytime that Handy is running. This is certainly not ideal. This also disables the computers ability to be able to sleep. This is also really not good. The overall energy impact on the system is quite small, but regardless we need the comptuer to sleep.\n\nCurrently I am a bit split what to do, for me, I don't care that the microphone is active all the time since I can read the source code and I can clearly see that nothing malicious is happening. However for an average user this behavior might be concering. The part which prevents sleep however, must be addressed.

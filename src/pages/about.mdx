# About Handy

I built Handy because I broke my finger and couldn't type. The existing speech-to-text apps weren't enough—I needed something I could actually extend and modify to work the way I needed it to work.

So I made something simple: press a keyboard shortcut, speak, press it again. Your words appear wherever you were typing. It runs completely offline using Whisper, works across platforms, and doesn't require subscriptions or cloud services.

## Why This Exists

Most speech-to-text software tries to be everything to everyone. Handy tries to be one thing really well: a foundation you can build on. It's intentionally simple because simple things are easier to understand, modify, and extend.

When you can't modify the tools you use, you're stuck with whatever someone else decided you needed. That's fine until it isn't. Handy gives you the source code, a clear architecture, and the freedom to make it work exactly how you want it to work.

## What It Actually Does

- Press a shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
- Transcribes your speech using Whisper Small
- Pastes the text directly into whatever app you're using
- Runs entirely on your machine with GPU acceleration
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

That's it. No accounts, no subscriptions, no cloud processing, no feature creep.

## The Real Purpose

Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app. It's trying to be the most forkable one.

Whether you need accessibility features, want to experiment with voice computing, or just prefer tools you can actually own and modify—this is a starting point. The codebase is designed to be readable and extensible. The architecture is simple enough to understand in an afternoon.

Take it, fork it, modify it, break it, fix it. Make it work for your specific needs instead of hoping someone else will build exactly what you want.

## Known Issues & Transparency

This is my first Rust project, and it shows. There are bugs, rough edges, and architectural decisions that could be better. I'm documenting the known issues openly because I'd rather have contributors who know what they're getting into than users who discover problems later.

The goal isn't perfection—it's utility and extensibility. If you find something that doesn't work, you have the tools to fix it. If you want a feature that doesn't exist, you can add it.

## Community & Contribution

I'm actively looking for contributors who want to help make this codebase cleaner, more robust, and more accessible. Whether that's fixing bugs, improving the architecture, adding features, or just helping other people understand how it works.

If you're experienced with Rust and want to help mentor someone learning the language, this project could use your guidance. If you're learning Rust yourself, this might be a good codebase to study and experiment with.

The goal is to build something that serves as both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon. A place where the community can come together to create something better than any one person could build alone.

## Get Started

Download it, try it, read the code. See if it works for what you need. If it doesn't, make it work. If you improve it, share those improvements back.

Your search for the right speech-to-text tool can end here—not because Handy is perfect, but because you can make it perfect for you.

NOTES

- i mean i would like to build more of these things and be paid, live off of this
    - donation thing
- this is yours now. i dont need to hold it anymore. i am here to help move it forward to the goals set out, but beyond that it is not on me.
- i want to learn from better people than me and you can also be a great example to the community
- detaching ego?
- accessibiity tools should be for all.

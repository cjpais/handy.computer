## App Language

Change the language of Handy's user interface. This is separate from the transcription language, which is configured in [Models](/docs/models).

## Version

Shows the current version of Handy installed on your machine.

## Directories

- **App Data Directory** - Where Handy stores configuration, models, and recordings
- **Log Directory** - Where Handy writes log files

You can click these to open them in your file manager. See [Debug > Finding Logs](/docs/debug#finding-logs) for the default paths on each platform.

## Support Development

Handy is free, open-source software built and maintained by a small team. If Handy is useful to you, please consider supporting its development. Every contribution makes a real difference and helps keep Handy free for everyone.

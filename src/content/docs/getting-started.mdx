## Download & Install

<PlatformDownload client:load />

## First Launch

<PlatformPermissions client:load />

### Choosing a Model

On first launch, Handy will ask you to pick a speech-to-text model to download. All models run entirely on your device.

- **Parakeet V3** (~478 MB) is recommended for English and European languages. Fast and accurate.
- **Whisper** is best for multilingual support with 99+ languages. Choose Small (~487 MB) for a good balance of speed and accuracy, or a larger variant if accuracy is critical.

See the [models page](/docs/models) for the full list of models and supported languages.

Once your model finishes downloading, Handy is ready to go. You'll see it appear in your system tray / menu bar.

## Your First Transcription

1. Click into any text field (a browser, editor, chat app, anywhere you can type)
2. Press the default shortcut to start recording
3. Speak naturally
4. Press the shortcut again (or release if using push-to-talk)
5. Your words appear in the text field

That's it. Handy transcribes your speech locally and pastes the result wherever your cursor is.

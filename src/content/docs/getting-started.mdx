## Download & Install

<PlatformDownload client:load />

## First Launch

<PlatformPermissions client:load />

### Choosing a Model

On first launch, Handy will ask you to pick a speech-to-text model to download. All models run entirely on your device.

- **Parakeet V3** is recommended for English and European languages. It's generally very fast on all machines, and very accurate.
- **Whisper** is best for multilingual support with 99+ languages. Choose Medium for a good balance of transcription performance and transcription speed. Use Small if you're on a less powerful machine.

See the [models page](/docs/models) for the full list of models and supported languages.

Once your model finishes downloading, Handy is ready to go. You'll see it appear in your system tray / menu bar.

## Your First Transcription

1. Click into any text field (a browser, editor, chat app, anywhere you can type)
2. Press the default shortcut (<DefaultShortcut client:load />) to start recording
3. Speak naturally
4. Press the shortcut again (or release if using push-to-talk)
5. Your words appear in the text field

That's it. Handy transcribes your speech locally and pastes the result wherever your cursor is.

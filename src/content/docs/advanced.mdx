The Advanced settings tab contains options for app behavior, text output tweaks, history management, and experimental features. Access these in **Settings > Advanced**.

For paste methods and typing tools, see the dedicated [Paste Methods](/docs/paste-methods) page.

## App

### Start Hidden

Launch Handy directly to the system tray without opening the main window. Useful if you want Handy running in the background at all times.

### Launch on Startup

Automatically start Handy when you log in to your computer.

### Show Tray Icon

Display the Handy icon in the system tray. When enabled, you can right-click the tray icon to access quick actions like unloading the model.

### Overlay Position

Control where the visual feedback overlay appears during recording and transcription.

- **Bottom** - Overlay appears at the bottom of your screen
- **Top** - Overlay appears at the top of your screen
- **None** - No overlay shown

On Linux, **None** is recommended because the overlay can steal focus from the target window and prevent pasting.

### Unload Model

Automatically free GPU/CPU memory when the model has not been used for a specified time. This is useful if you run other GPU-intensive applications and want Handy to release memory when idle.

Options:
- Never
- Immediately
- After 2 minutes
- After 5 minutes
- After 10 minutes
- After 15 minutes
- After 1 hour

You can also right-click the system tray icon and select "Unload Model" to free memory manually.

## Output

### Auto Submit

Automatically send a key combination after text insertion. Useful for chat apps and command lines where you want to send immediately after dictating.

Options:
- **Off** - No auto-submit (default)
- **Enter** - Simulates pressing Enter
- **Cmd+Enter** - For macOS apps where Cmd+Enter sends
- **Super+Enter** - For Windows/Linux apps
- **Ctrl+Enter** - For apps where Ctrl+Enter sends (e.g., some chat apps)

### Clipboard Handling

Control what happens to your clipboard after Handy pastes text.

- **Don't Modify Clipboard** - Handy restores your previous clipboard contents after pasting. Your clipboard history is preserved.
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Handy leaves the transcription in your clipboard after pasting. Useful if you want to paste the same text again elsewhere.

## Transcription

### Custom Words

Add words that are frequently misheard during transcription. Handy will automatically correct similar-sounding words to match your list. This is useful for names, jargon, or technical terms the model gets wrong.

Examples:

| Misheard | Corrected To |
|----------|-------------|
| "handy" | "Handy" |
| "astro js" | "Astro.js" |
| "c j" | "CJ" |

You can adjust how aggressively corrections are applied using the Word Correction Threshold in the [Debug](/docs/debug) settings.

### Append Trailing Space

When enabled, Handy adds a space after the pasted transcription. Convenient for continuous dictation where you want a space between consecutive transcriptions.

## History

### History Limit

Set the maximum number of history entries to keep. Older entries are removed when the limit is reached.

### Auto-Delete Recordings

Automatically delete old audio recordings to save disk space.

Options:
- Never
- Keep latest N recordings
- After 3 days
- After 2 weeks
- After 3 months

## Experimental Features

Enable experimental features that are still in development. Turning this on reveals additional options:

### Post Processing

Enable AI-powered text refinement after transcription. When enabled, a new **Post Process** section appears in the sidebar. See the [Post-Processing](/docs/post-processing) guide for setup instructions.

### Keyboard Implementation

Choose the keyboard shortcut backend. This controls how Handy registers and listens for keyboard shortcuts. In most cases, the default works fine. If you experience issues with shortcuts not registering, you can try switching the implementation.

**Note:** Changing the keyboard implementation may reset your keyboard shortcuts to defaults.

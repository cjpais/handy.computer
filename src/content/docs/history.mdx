The History tab shows all your past transcriptions. Access it from the sidebar in Handy's settings window.

Each entry shows the timestamp, the transcribed text, and an audio player to play back the original recording. You can copy any transcription to your clipboard, star it to prevent auto-deletion, or delete it entirely. Use the button at the top of the History tab to open the recordings folder on disk.

## Managing History

These settings are in [Advanced > History](/docs/advanced#history).

### History Limit

Set the maximum number of history entries to keep. Older entries are removed when the limit is reached. Set this to **0** to disable history entirely

### Auto-Delete Recordings

Automatically delete old audio recordings to save disk space. The "Keep latest N" option uses the History Limit value. The other options delete after some timeframe instead of number of recordings.

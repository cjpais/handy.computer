The General settings tab contains your core recording and audio configuration. These are the settings most users will interact with day-to-day.

## Transcribe Shortcut

The keyboard shortcut used to record and transcribe your voice. In the default push-to-talk mode, hold the shortcut to record and release it to stop. In toggle mode, press once to start and again to stop.

The default shortcut is `Option + Space` on macOS and `Ctrl + Space` on Windows/Linux. You can customize this by clicking the shortcut field and pressing your preferred key combination.

On macOS, many people like using the `Fn` key. On Windows and Linux, shortcuts require at least one modifier key (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) plus a regular key by default. You can enable the experimental Handy Keys implementation in [Advanced](/docs/advanced#keyboard-implementation) settings for more flexible bindings.

## Push To Talk

Hold the shortcut to record, release to stop. This is the default recording mode and is great for quick dictation. It avoids accidentally leaving the mic on.

### Toggle Mode

When Push To Talk is disabled, Handy uses toggle mode instead. Press the shortcut once to start recording, press again to stop and transcribe.

## Sound

### Microphone

Select which microphone Handy uses for recording. By default, Handy uses your system's default input device. If you have multiple microphones (USB, Bluetooth, built-in), you can pick a specific one here. On a Macbook we highly recommend using the built in microphone. 

Note Bluetooth devices can have issues with Handy. We are working on improving support for Bluetooth microphones/headsets.

Use the refresh button next to the dropdown to rescan for newly connected devices.

### Mute While Recording

When enabled, Handy mutes your system audio while recording. This means music or whatever else is playing will temporarily be silenced.

### Audio Feedback

When enabled, Handy plays a sound when recording starts and stops. This gives you a clear audio cue that Handy is listening.

### Output Device

Choose which audio device plays the feedback sounds. Only available when Audio Feedback is enabled. Use the refresh button to rescan for devices.

### Volume

Adjust the volume of the audio feedback sounds. Only available when Audio Feedback is enabled.

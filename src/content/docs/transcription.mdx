## Recording Modes

Handy supports two recording modes:

### Toggle Mode

Press the shortcut once to start recording, press again to stop. This is the default mode.

### Push-to-Talk

Hold the shortcut to record, release to stop and transcribe. Great for quick dictation and avoids accidentally leaving the mic on.

You can switch between modes in Handy's settings.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The default shortcut is `Cmd + Shift + .` on macOS and `Ctrl + Shift + .` on Windows/Linux. You can customize this in the settings.

## Overlay

When recording, Handy shows a small overlay indicator so you know it's listening. The overlay appears near your cursor or in a fixed position depending on your settings.

## Cancelling a Transcription

If you start recording by accident, you can cancel:

- Press `Escape` while recording to cancel without transcribing
- The overlay will disappear and nothing will be pasted

## Silence Detection

Handy uses a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) filter to automatically trim silence from your recordings. This means pauses and quiet moments are removed before transcription, improving both speed and accuracy.

## Tips for Better Transcription

- Speak clearly and at a natural pace
- Minimize background noise when possible
- Use a dedicated microphone for best results (see [Audio settings](/docs/audio))
- Set your language explicitly if you always speak the same one (see [Models](/docs/models))

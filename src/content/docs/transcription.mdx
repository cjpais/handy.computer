## Recording Modes

Handy supports two recording modes:

### Push-to-Talk

Hold the shortcut to record, release to stop and transcribe. This is the default mode. Great for quick dictation and avoids accidentally leaving the mic on.

### Toggle Mode

Press the shortcut once to start recording, press again to stop.

You can switch between modes in **Settings > General**.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The default shortcut is `Option + Space` on macOS and `Ctrl + Space` on Windows/Linux. You can customize this in **Settings > General**.

You can also set a separate shortcut for transcription with post-processing. See [Post-Processing](/docs/post-processing#dedicated-hotkey) for details.

## Overlay

When recording, Handy shows a small visual overlay so you know it's listening. You can configure the overlay position in **Settings > Advanced**:

- **Bottom** - overlay appears at the bottom of your screen
- **Top** - overlay appears at the top of your screen
- **None** - no overlay shown (recommended on Linux where it can steal focus)

### Overlay States

The overlay shows the current state:

- **Recording** - Handy is listening to your microphone
- **Processing...** - Transcription is running (and post-processing, if enabled)

**Note:** The (x) button on the overlay cancels the recording and discards all audio. It does not stop and transcribe. To stop recording and get your transcription, press the keyboard shortcut again.

## Cancelling a Transcription

If you start recording by accident, you can cancel:

- Press `Escape` while recording to cancel without transcribing
- Click the (x) button on the overlay
- The overlay will disappear and nothing will be pasted

You can customize the cancel shortcut in the [Debug](/docs/debug) settings (not available on Linux).

## Silence Detection

Handy uses a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) filter to automatically trim silence from your recordings. Pauses and quiet moments are removed before transcription, improving both speed and accuracy.

## Automatic Cleanup

Handy automatically cleans up transcription output:

- **Filler word removal** - Common filler words (um, uh, etc.) are removed automatically
- **Hallucination filtering** - Whisper models sometimes hallucinate artifacts like "Thank you for watching" or "Bye bye" at the end of recordings. Handy detects and removes these common hallucination patterns

## Tips for Better Transcription

- Speak clearly and at a natural pace
- Minimize background noise when possible
- Use a dedicated microphone for best results (see [General > Sound](/docs/general#sound))
- Set your language explicitly if you always speak the same one (see [Models](/docs/models))
- Keep recordings under 3-5 minutes for best results with current models

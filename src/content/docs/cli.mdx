## Overview

Handy can be launched from the command line with flags to customize its behavior. This is useful for scripting, automation, and window manager integration.

## Flags

```bash
handy [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--model <MODEL>` | Set the speech-to-text model to use |
| `--language <LANG>` | Set the language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `de`) |
| `--push-to-talk` | Enable push-to-talk mode |
| `--no-overlay` | Disable the recording overlay |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--toggle-transcription` | Toggle transcription on/off in a running instance |
| `--toggle-transcription-post-process` | Toggle transcription with post-processing on/off |

The `--toggle-transcription` and `--toggle-transcription-post-process` flags communicate with an already-running Handy instance. If Handy is recording, it stops and transcribes. If idle, it starts recording. This is useful for binding to window manager shortcuts.

## Signal Control

On macOS and Linux, you can control a running Handy instance using Unix signals:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `SIGUSR2` | Toggle transcription (start/stop recording) |
| `SIGUSR1` | Toggle transcription with post-processing |

```bash
# Toggle transcription
pkill -USR2 -x handy

# Toggle transcription with post-processing
pkill -USR1 -x handy
```

Signal control is the **recommended approach for Wayland** where global keyboard shortcuts often don't work natively. Bind the signal command to a shortcut in your compositor.

## Scripting

You can use Handy in scripts to capture speech-to-text output. This is especially useful for automation workflows.

## Window Manager Integration

Handy works well with tiling window managers and custom keybinding setups. Use either CLI flags or signals to control Handy from your compositor.

### Hyprland

```bash
# Using signals (recommended)
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, period, exec, pkill -USR2 -x handy

# Using CLI flags
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, period, exec, handy --toggle-transcription
```

### sway / i3

```bash
# Using signals (recommended)
bindsym $mod+Shift+period exec pkill -USR2 -x handy

# Using CLI flags
bindsym $mod+Shift+period exec handy --toggle-transcription
```

### GNOME (Wayland)

GNOME on Wayland doesn't support global shortcuts from third-party apps. Use a custom shortcut that sends a signal:

1. Open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
2. Add a new shortcut with the command: `pkill -USR2 -x handy`
3. Assign your preferred key combination

### macOS (Hammerspoon)

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "shift"}, ".", function()
    hs.execute("/Applications/Handy.app/Contents/MacOS/handy --push-to-talk")
end)
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HANDY_MODEL` | Default model to use |
| `HANDY_LANGUAGE` | Default language code |
| `HANDY_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode (`1` or `true`) |

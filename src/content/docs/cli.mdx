## Overview

Handy can be launched from the command line with flags to customize its behavior. This is useful for scripting, automation, and window manager integration.

## Flags

```bash
handy [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--model <MODEL>` | Set the speech-to-text model to use |
| `--language <LANG>` | Set the language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `de`) |
| `--push-to-talk` | Enable push-to-talk mode |
| `--no-overlay` | Disable the recording overlay |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |

## Scripting

You can use Handy in scripts to capture speech-to-text output. This is especially useful for automation workflows.

## Window Manager Integration

Handy works well with tiling window managers and custom keybinding setups:

### Hyprland

```bash
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, period, exec, handy --push-to-talk
```

### sway / i3

```bash
bindsym $mod+Shift+period exec handy --push-to-talk
```

### macOS (Hammerspoon)

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "shift"}, ".", function()
    hs.execute("/Applications/Handy.app/Contents/MacOS/handy --push-to-talk")
end)
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HANDY_MODEL` | Default model to use |
| `HANDY_LANGUAGE` | Default language code |
| `HANDY_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode (`1` or `true`) |

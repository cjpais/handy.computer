## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed logs:

1. Launch Handy with the `--debug` flag, or
2. Set the environment variable `HANDY_DEBUG=1`

Debug logs include model loading times, audio device info, transcription timing, and paste method details.

## Common Issues

### Handy isn't transcribing anything

- Check that your microphone is not muted
- Make sure a model has been downloaded (check settings)
- Try switching to a different microphone in settings
- Enable debug mode to check for errors

### Text isn't being pasted

- Make sure your cursor is in a text field before starting transcription
- Try switching the paste method in settings
- On macOS, ensure Handy has Accessibility permissions (**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**)
- On Linux, some Wayland compositors may need additional configuration for simulated input

### Slow transcription

- Try a smaller model (Tiny or Base)
- Check that GPU acceleration is being used (visible in debug logs)
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

### Microphone not detected

- Check system audio settings to ensure the mic is recognized
- Try unplugging and reconnecting the microphone
- On Linux, check that PulseAudio or PipeWire is running

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Handy requires **Accessibility** and **Microphone** permissions
- If Handy can't paste, re-add it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
- Metal GPU acceleration is used automatically

### Windows

- Run the installer as administrator if you encounter permission issues
- Vulkan drivers are required for GPU acceleration
- Make sure your audio drivers are up to date

### Linux

- AppImage requires FUSE (`sudo apt install libfuse2` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- Wayland users may need `xdg-desktop-portal` for paste to work
- X11 generally works out of the box
- Vulkan drivers are needed for GPU acceleration (`vulkan-tools` to verify)

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed logs. See the [Debug](/docs/debug) page for how to enable it and where to find log files.

## Common Issues

### Handy is not transcribing anything

- Check that your microphone is not muted at the system level
- Make sure a model has been downloaded (check **Settings > Models**)
- Try switching to a different microphone in **Settings > General**
- Enable debug mode and check the logs for errors

### Text is not being pasted

- Make sure your cursor is in a text field before starting transcription
- Try switching the paste method in **Settings > Advanced** (see [Paste Methods](/docs/paste-methods))
- On macOS, ensure Handy has Accessibility permissions (**System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**)
- On Linux, check your typing tool configuration (see [Paste Methods > Typing Tools](/docs/paste-methods#typing-tools-linux))
- Try increasing the paste delay in [Debug](/docs/debug#paste-delay) settings

### Wrong text is being pasted

If Handy pastes your previous clipboard contents instead of the transcription, increase the paste delay in [Debug](/docs/debug#paste-delay) settings. The default is 60ms; try 100-200ms.

### Slow transcription

- Try a smaller model (Moonshine Tiny or Whisper Small)
- Check that GPU acceleration is being used (visible in debug logs)
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Configure the model unload timeout in [Advanced](/docs/advanced#unload-model) settings

### Microphone not detected

- Check system audio settings to ensure the mic is recognized
- Try unplugging and reconnecting the microphone
- Use the refresh button next to the microphone dropdown in **Settings > General**
- On Linux, check that PulseAudio or PipeWire is running

### Whisper crashes

Whisper models can crash on certain hardware configurations, particularly older CPUs and some Windows/Linux systems. If Whisper crashes:

1. **Use Parakeet V3 instead** - it is the most stable model and recommended for English
2. Try a smaller Whisper model (Small instead of Medium or Large)
3. Update your GPU drivers (Vulkan support is required)
4. Run with `--debug` to capture crash details for bug reports

### vulkan-1.dll not found (Windows)

Update your GPU drivers (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel). Vulkan is required for GPU acceleration. If your GPU is too old to support Vulkan, Handy may not work on your system.

- **NVIDIA**: Download from [nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
- **AMD**: Download from [amd.com/en/support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
- **Intel**: Download from [intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

### Garbled text with non-QWERTY keyboards

If Handy outputs garbled text when you use AZERTY, QWERTZ, or other non-US keyboard layouts, you are likely using the Direct Input paste method. Switch to a clipboard-based paste method. See [Paste Methods](/docs/paste-methods#garbled-text-with-non-qwerty-keyboards) for details.

### Blank window on Linux

On some Linux systems, Handy may show a blank window due to a WebKit DMA-BUF rendering issue. Recent versions of Handy set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` automatically. If you are on an older version, set this environment variable manually:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 handy
```

### AppImage GLIBC error (Linux)

The AppImage requires GLIBC 2.38+. Ubuntu 22.04 ships with GLIBC 2.35 and is incompatible. Solutions:
- Use the `.deb` package instead of the AppImage
- Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04+ or another distribution with GLIBC 2.38+

### Overlay steals focus on Linux

On some Linux desktop environments, the Handy overlay takes focus away from the target window, preventing paste. Set **Overlay Position** to **None** in **Settings > Advanced**. See [Advanced > Overlay Position](/docs/advanced#overlay-position).

### Wayland overlay not showing

The Wayland overlay requires `gtk-layer-shell` as a runtime dependency:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0`
- **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install gtk4-layer-shell`

Note: On KDE Wayland, gtk-layer-shell initialization is skipped to prevent overlay issues.

### Failed model download

If a model download fails partway through and you cannot re-download it:

1. Go to **About > App Data Directory**
2. Navigate to the `models/` folder
3. Delete any partially downloaded files
4. Restart Handy and try the download again

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Handy requires **Accessibility** and **Microphone** permissions
- If Handy cannot paste, re-add it in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
- Metal GPU acceleration is used automatically
- Install via Homebrew: `brew install --cask handy`

### Windows

- Run the installer as administrator if you encounter permission issues
- Vulkan drivers are required for GPU acceleration
- Make sure your audio drivers are up to date
- If Handy cannot paste into apps running as administrator, run Handy as administrator too
- For pasting into terminals (CMD, PowerShell), use the Shift+Insert paste method

### Linux

- AppImage requires FUSE (`sudo apt install libfuse2` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- Wayland users should configure a [typing tool](/docs/paste-methods#typing-tools-linux) for paste to work
- X11 generally works out of the box
- Vulkan drivers are needed for GPU acceleration (`vulkan-tools` to verify)
- Control Handy from scripts/WMs using [signals or CLI flags](/docs/cli#signal-control)
- Set overlay to None if it steals focus from the target window

## Known Issues

- **Whisper instability on certain hardware** - Whisper models may crash on older CPUs or specific GPU configurations. Use Parakeet V3 as a stable alternative.
- **Linux audio playback in history** - Audio playback of recorded history entries may not work on some Linux configurations.

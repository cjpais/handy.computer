## Microphone Selection

Handy uses your system's default microphone by default. You can select a specific microphone in the settings if you have multiple audio input devices.

## Clamshell Mode

On macOS laptops, closing the lid (clamshell mode) with an external display switches to any connected external microphone. Handy handles this transition automatically.

## Mute Behavior

If your microphone is muted at the system level, Handy will record silence. Make sure your mic is unmuted before recording. Handy does not override system-level mute.

## Audio Feedback

Handy can play sounds to indicate recording state:

- **Start sound**: Plays when recording begins
- **Stop sound**: Plays when recording ends and transcription starts

You can enable or disable these sounds in the settings.

## Tips for Better Audio

- Use a dedicated USB or Bluetooth microphone for clearer input
- Position the microphone close to your mouth
- Reduce background noise. Close windows, turn off fans if possible
- If transcription quality is poor, check your input level in system audio settings

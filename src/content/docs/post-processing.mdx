## Overview

Post-processing lets you run your transcription through an AI language model before it gets pasted. This can fix grammar, reformat text, translate, or apply any custom transformation you want.

## Setting Up a Provider

To use post-processing, you need to configure an AI provider in Handy's settings:

1. Open Handy settings
2. Go to the Post-Processing section
3. Select a provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local model)
4. Enter your API key

## Custom Prompts

You can write custom prompts that tell the AI how to process your text. Use the `${output}` template variable to reference the transcription.

### Example Prompts

**Fix grammar and punctuation:**
```
Fix any grammar or punctuation errors in the following text,
but don't change the meaning or tone: ${output}
```

**Convert to bullet points:**
```
Convert the following text into concise bullet points: ${output}
```

**Translate to Spanish:**
```
Translate the following English text to Spanish: ${output}
```

## The `${output}` Template

The `${output}` variable in your prompt is replaced with the raw transcription before being sent to the AI. This lets you place the transcription anywhere in your prompt.

## Tips

- Keep prompts concise for faster processing
- Test your prompts with short recordings first
- Post-processing adds latency since it requires an API call
- You can disable post-processing at any time without losing your prompt configuration

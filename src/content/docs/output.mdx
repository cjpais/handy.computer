## How Handy Pastes Text

After transcription, Handy pastes the result into whatever text field your cursor is in. It does this by simulating a paste action using your system clipboard.

## Paste Methods

Handy supports different paste methods depending on your platform and needs:

- **Clipboard paste** (default): Copies text to clipboard and simulates `Cmd/Ctrl + V`
- **Direct input**: Types text character by character (useful for apps that don't support paste)

## Clipboard Behavior

By default, Handy temporarily uses your clipboard to paste text, then restores your previous clipboard contents. This means your clipboard history is preserved.

## Auto-Submit

When enabled, Handy can automatically press Enter after pasting. Useful for chat apps and command lines where you want to send immediately after dictating.

## Custom Words

Custom words help Handy recognize names, jargon, or technical terms that the model might otherwise get wrong. You can add custom word replacements in the settings.

### Examples

| Spoken | Replaced With |
|--------|---------------|
| "handy" | "Handy" |
| "astro js" | "Astro.js" |
| "c j" | "CJ" |

Custom words are applied as simple text replacements after transcription.

## Formatting

Transcription output preserves natural sentence structure with punctuation. For additional formatting or cleanup, see [Post-Processing](/docs/post-processing).
